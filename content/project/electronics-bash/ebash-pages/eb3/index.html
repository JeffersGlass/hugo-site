<p class="post-paragraph">In this stream, we'll be looking at:</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>Stepper motor control</li>
<li>Serial control</li>
<li>The DO...WHILE loop</li>
<li>randomness and the random() funciton</li>
<li>Probably more!</li>
</ul>
<p class="post-paragraph">This is the space where I'll be posting code samples and circuit layouts sometime in advance of the stream, for those who want to follow along more directly. This is the first stream I'll be doing this for, so you can expect the formatting and content here to change significantly over time as I figure out how to lay out this space.</p>

<h4 class="post-h4">Servo Basic</h4>
<p class="post-paragraph">Shows the basic functionality of a Servo attached to pin 9. Steps from 0, to 90 degrees, to 180 degrees and back, pausing for 1 second in between each position.</p>

<h4 class="post-h4">Servo Sweep</h4>
<p class="post-paragraph">This code will sweep the Servo attached to pin 9 back and forth between 0 and 180 degrees using a pair of FOR loops. This is literally the Servo &gt; Sweep example from the Servo library.</p>
