<p class="post-paragraph">Hand soldering a prototype is all well and good. Heck, making two or three of a thing isn't too bad. But what if you need ten widgets, all wired together the same way? Or a hundred? Or you're using parts too small to be wired to perfboard? These are situations where an inexpensive Printed Circuit Board (PCB) comes in handy.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">PCBs are easier to design, order, and use than ever! In this session we'll look at:</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>Schematic Capture (getting your circuit design into the computer)</li>
<li>Circuit board layout</li>
<li>Creating custom parts and part footprints from a datasheet</li>
<li>Ordering a circuit board from an online board house</li>
</ul>
