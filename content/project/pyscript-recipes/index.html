<p class="post-p"><a href="https://pyscript.net">PyScript</a> is a surprisingly simple and relatively comlex entity. At it's core, it allows users to <span class="mono">write Python into their HTML</span> with a special kind of script tag. And it does just that! But with that simple idea lies a word of complexity, especially once you realize you can <a href="">pull in any JavaScript object</a>, make use of <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/type-conversions.html">Pyodide's extensive API</a>, and start <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/webworker.html">interacting with Web Workers</a>.</p>
<p class="post-p">That's why I launched <a href="https://pyscript.recipe" class="font-bold">pyscript.recipes</a>, a collection of short, rapidly-useful snipets for PyScript to keep developers moving fast.</p>
<p class="post-p">As of today, the site is fully updated for the newest PyScript release, and live. </p>

<p class="post-p">The whole site is also open source - have a recipe or correction you'd like to contribute? Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/JeffersGlass/pyscript-recipes">drop in a PR on GitHub</a>.</p>
