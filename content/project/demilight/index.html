<p class="mb-4">The Demilight project began in 2019 with the goal of creating a 3D printable, miniature moving light controlled by an Arduino-compatible microcontroller. This page catalogs the current state of the project, along with project history and assembly instructions.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Currently, the project is on Version 0.9.4.</p>
<p class="mb-4">There are still enough rough-edges that the project that I haven't published the STLs for the 3D-printed parts, nor the gerbers/BOM for the controller. I don't intend to try to reach perfection before releasing everything, I just want to get rid of some of the more egregious 'gotchas' so someone who's not me stands a good chance of building one successfully.</p>
<p class="mb-4">In reverse chronological order, the version history is as follows:</p>

                <p class="pb-4"><span class="font-bold">Version 0.9.3</span> corrected the BOM issues with version 0.9.1 and, on the advice of some fellow nerds during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vGnjwXSNCY">livestream in November 2020</a>, changing the 0.1" header connectors on the power/data input to a Phoenix connector. These pluggable terminal blocks proved to have much better mechanical characteristics than the 0.1" headers, and will likely be the primary connection method going forward. A new version of the DMX/Power injector board was also created using phoenix connectors. (All are 0.15" pitch, which seems to be the smallest commonly-available pitch.)</p>
                <p class="pb-4">Unfortunately, version 0.9.3 had a critical flaw in one of its other minor improvements. In the same livestream, it was discovered that the maximum safe operating power for the LEDs was about 5W before their solder started to melt. To match this, and with a forward voltage of roughly 10.7V on the LED chips in use, the 0.9.3 PCBs were assembled with a 200 mOhm resistor attached to the RSET pin of the AL8860 LED driver, capping its max current to roughly 500 mA. Thinking it would be a nice feature for users to "overdrive" their board, a non-populated thru-hole resistor pad was dropped in in parallel with the 200 mOhm resistor, so users could reduce the resistance on that pin. But here, an error was mode. The resistor's pads shorted out a 24V trace on the bottom of the PCB, causing the AL8860 to catch fire when the intensity of the LED was raised too high.</p>
                <p class="pb-4">Version 0.9.4 will correct this critical issue, and make other minor adjustments, like retracting the phoenix connector back into the housing by ~0.1" and cleaning up some labelling.    </p>
                <p class="pb-4">All 3D printed parts for version 0.9.1 were the same as version 0.9.1, with the exception that the Case Bottom was heightened by a few millimeters to allow clearance for the new, cheaper 5V buck converter modules.</p>
                <p class="pb-4">PCBs for this version were first ordered and assembled in November, 2020.</p>

                <p class="pb-4"><span class="font-bold">Version 0.9 and Version 0.9.1</span> were a first-stab at learning what it would mean to produce the PCBs (and the lights themselves) at 'scale.' The scale in this case was 10 PCBs, ordered assembled from JLCPCB like version 0.8.</p>
                <p class="pb-4">Unfortunately, due to a typo in the Bill of Materials file sent to JLCPCB, all of the positions for 0603 10K resistors were instead stuffed with 0603 green LEDs, which required <a href="https://youtu.be/P-ZiBg6NIeI">manually reworking ~100 components over 10 boards</a>. This was done with a bodging tool consisting of a bit of copper wire wrapped around a soldering iron; soldering tweezers were later procured.</p>
                <p class="pb-4">Additional changes to the PCB included:</p>
                <ul class="pl-6 list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Widening the holes for the 5V buck converter so that a PCB-based converter module could be used instead of an encapsulated buck converter, to lower costs per board</li>
                    <li>Adding a footprint for the MSOP-8 footprint of the AL8860 buck-converter LED driver, since the TSOT25 version is sometimes not stocked at JLCPCB and elsewhere</li>
                    <li>Changing the mounting hole(s) for the PCB to a single hole immediately behind the power/DMX input connector</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pb-4">Change to the 3D Printed files included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New friction-tab mechanism for locking the two halves of the body together</li>
                    <li>Adjustments to the case bottom to accept the new mounting hardware</li>
                    <li>Larger clearance on the body for the tilt-servo connector to pass through</li>
                    <li>PCBs for this version were first ordered and assembled in July, 2020.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="pb-4"><span class="font-bold">Version 0.8</span> was essentially a bug-fix revision to correct some of the issues stemming from being over-ambitious with version. The results, however, were were successful.</p>
                <p class="pb-4">The 0.05" pogo-pin programming header was replaced with a standard 0.1" ISP programming header, doing away with the need to pre-flash the Arduino bootloader onto the ATmega before soldering. This worked well, though it does take up quite a bit more board area than the pogo-pin setup, so returning to a smaller form factor at some point will be desireable.</p>
                <p class="pb-4">Additionally, some of the routing with regards to the onboard LEDs and the ceramic resonator was cleaned up.</p>
                <p class="pb-4">The largest remaining error on the PCB is a mis-sized buck-converter module - as currently laid out, the spec'd module overlaps the TILT servo header connector by almost 50%. This means the buck converters have to be massaged into a workable position with their pins bent, which is obviously not idea. However, there is space on the board for the component if the pads were correctly placed, so this should be a relatively easy fix.</p>
                <p class="pb-4">This revision also highlights the fact that the 3D-printed parts haven't really been updated since version 0.4, and we're tweaked to account for the new PCB, including the new placement of the 4-wire connector and the lack of a pro-mini programming header. The next version will need to incorporate those changes, as well as some tolerance adjustments.</p>
                <p class="pb-4">PCBs for this version were first ordered and assembled in June, 2020.</p>
