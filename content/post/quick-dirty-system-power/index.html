<p class="font-bold post-p">Tl;DR Computers hate having their power abruptly cut. A UPS, an Adafruit Feather board, and some python hackery keeps computers booting and shutting down gracefully when power is yanked and restored, deliberately or not.</p>
<p class="post-p"><hr/></p>
<p class="post-p">My dayjob involves solving technical problems for a large, multi-acre education facility with over 400 computer-driven interactives. To prolong the life of these devices (many of which are built around off-the-shelf computers and monitors), we like to power them down after operating hours and start them up in the morning. These are mostly windows machines, and just like a desktop they <span class="italic">love</span> to be rebooted.</p>
<p class="post-p">What makes this challenging is both the number and placement of these devices. While many are in dedicated control rooms with <a href="">linked KVM systems</a>, even using a mouse and keyboard to manually shut down 400 PCs would take the onsite staff far longer than designed, and could be error-prone. Worse, some computers are embedded inside consoles, cabinets, and displays, making the process of walking around and hitting power buttons (where accessible) or using a wireless keyboard (where not) even longer. The same is true of startup, except that a wireless keyboard isn't an option in that case. A central startup and shutdown solution is essential.</p>

    <img src="medialon.jpg" alt="A complex touchscreen controller based around a Medialon control system" class="post-img">
    <p class="max-w-xl post-img-caption">Not from my workplace, but grabbed from google images - just as an example of how involved a software-defined control system can be.</p>
</div>
<p class="post-p">Of course, there are many ways to make this happen. The most ideal, when the money is available, is to use a central controller, like a <a href="https://medialon.com/products/showmaster-pro/">Medialon System</a>, <a href="https://www.crestron.com/Products/Control-Hardware-Software/Hardware">Creston Controller</a>, <a href="https://derivative.ca/">TouchDesigner interface</a>, or similar. The control is put in charge of signalling the computers to wake up (via Wake-on-LAN), shut down (through  proprietary software modules), and handles cycling <a href="https://www.se.com/us/en/product-range/7340-powerlink-intelligent-panelboards/#overview">remotely-controller AC breakers</a>, turning projcets on and off via various ethernet protocols, and so on. The dream is for whoever's operating the system to press one button (or click one button on a screen) to have the whole system turn on, or off.</p>
<p class="post-p">Life is rarely a dream.</p>
<p class="post-p">We sometimes run into a situation where, for reasons of cost, planning, location, or timing, there is no exterior control of any kind. There's just a breaker in a panel (which may or may not be remote controlled) providing power to an installed cabinet. And as much as PC's love to be rebooted, they <span class="italic">hate</span> having their power yanked unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="post-p">So the challenge is: <span class="font-bold">given only control over their power, can we create a system that soft-starts and soft-shuts-down a PC?</span> <span class="italic">(Yes we can, or this would be a very short post.)</span></p>
<p class="post-p"><hr/></p>
<p class="post-h2">Shutdown</p>
<p class="post-p">Getting a PC to soft shutdown on power loss is relatively straightfoward. There are (fairly fancy) <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/categories/power/uninterruptible-power-supply-ups-/ups-management/ups-network-management-cards/N-o7asnt">networkable UPS systems and add-on cards</a> that are meant just for this kind of thing. When mains power is killed, the UPS kicks into keep the computer(s) in question on, while sending a network message to do... whatever you want. Wait a minute then hibernate, run a backup, dump memory, etc.</p>
<p class="post-p">Unfortunately, these solutions are somewhat cost-prohibitive, and also rather large. They seem designed for rackmount systems where they could be used to manage a bank of servers. The particular situation that I'm building this for for is very tightly space-confired, and doing it for less than a grand would be great.</p>

    <img src="apcups.jpg" alt="A complex touchscreen controller based around a Medialon control system" class="post-img">
    <p class="max-w-xl post-img-caption">A cheap, off the shelf, 300W / ~30wH UPS. At time of writing, about $60 shipped.</p>
</div>
<p class="post-p">Thankfully, there's a way to make this work on a cheaper and smaller UPS. Many off-the-shelf UPS's have the abilitiy to connect directly to a single PC via USB connection. APC, who makes consumer UPSes, has such a connection on even their <a href="https://amzn.to/31ciSpg">very basic units</a>. They even include <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/categories/power/uninterruptible-power-supply-ups-/ups-management/powerchute-personal-edition/N-1b6nbpp">some basic software (Powerchute)</a> that can tell the computer to hibernate, shutdown, wait a few minutes and shutdown, etc when the batteries kick in. Sounds perfect, no?</p>
<p class="post-p">Not quite - we only have the ability to hook one computer directly to the UPS, but we'd like to power multiple small computers <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc.html">(often NUCs)</a> off a single UPS. And there's no obvious way to hook into the Powerchute software directly. Having one UPS per computer would be an option, but a needlessly expensive one. Sometimes there's not even enough room for that to be possible.</p>
<p class="post-p">The workaround is straightfoward - the Powerchute software logs an event to the Window System Log when it swtches to battery power. We can use Window's built-in task scheduling service to fire off a script of our choosing when this event occurs. Then it's just a matter of crafting some very basic network scripts to allow the UPS-connected computer to tell other computers to shut down, then shut itself down.</p>
<p class="post-p">Here's what I came up with. It's not terrible robust, secure, or debuggable, but it's getting the job done for now. The client script runs on the computer connected to a UPS, and is triggered when the UPS switches to battery power. The server runs on as many connected computers as we want, and should be set to run at startup. The (static) IPs of the computers running the server script must be enterred in the client script.</p>

</div>
<p class="post-p">Almost every BIOS has the ability to wake the system when power is restored following an unexpected power loss. Most have the ability to boot the computer when power is removed and restored, regardless of whether the computer was gently shut down or rudely had its power cut. Unfortunately, neither of these options work for us - since the computer is on a UPS, as far the the power supply is concerned,<span class="italic"> the computer never loses power.</span> So, we'll have to rely on some other mechanism to detect when power is restored to cause the computer(s) to boot.</p>
<p class="post-p">The hammer for this particular nail is a small, ethernet-capable microcontroller that sends out Wake-on-LAN packets at regular intervals whenever its powered on. We plug this microcontroller into an outlet <span class="underline">not</span> backed by the UPS - when power is lost, the microcontroller shuts off almost immediately, allowing the computers to shut down as above. When power is restored, the microcontroller starts up and, after a brief delay, starts sending out Wake-On-LAN messages to all the MAC addresses it knows about.</p>
<p class="post-p">I chose the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5000">Adafruit ESP-32 Feather</a> for a couple reasons. One, Python is <a href="/tags/python">my language of choice</a> for hacking things together, and I was excited to play more with <a href="https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html">CircuitPython</a>. Second, Adafruit's commitment to documentation and process is just great, and I wanted to get this project up on its feet quickly. And third, Adafruit's Featherwing line of accessory boards (specifically the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3201">Ethernet Featherwing</a>) made it easy to get an Ethernet Stack and PHY running with minimal custom effort.</p>
<p class="post-p">So, I bashed together the following code to wake up, establish a network connection, and send a Wake-On-LAN message to each MAC address in a given array every 15 seconds or so:</p>
