<p class="post-p">Last winter, I participated in the annual <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code Challenge</a>, a website which offers small (<em>but not necessarily easy</em>) programming challenges every day from December 1 through 25. It turned out to be a great way to get exposed to different corners of development in my language of choice (Python), and with a little more time on my hands this Winter, I'm excited to dive into it again.</p>
<p class="post-p">The challenges are all written in a non-programming-language-specific way. For example, the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1">first part of the problem from December 1, 2019</a> boils down to:</p>
<div class="pl-8 font-mono">
<p>* Ingest a list of numbers from a text file, with one line per number</p>
<p>* For each number, divide it by 3, round down, and subtract 2</p>
<p>* Sum all these results together</p>
<p>* Print/return/somehow give the user back the sum</p>
</div>
<p class="post-p">While I was doing this in Python, there's no reason you couldn't do it in C, or Java, or Haskell, or ALGOL, or any language of your choice (<em>though of course, some of the problems will be more tractable using structures built into some langauges and not othe</em>rs<em>)</em>. The actual prompts are a bit more flavorful that that example - a narrative about needed to rescue Santa from outer-space was woven through all 25 problem last year.</p>
<p class="post-p">I'm confident in saying that my Python has gotten significantly stronger over the past year, but I'm feeling like I could be stronger in some algorithmic thinking (the <em>mazes</em> last year slayed me) and in some process crevices around my workflow. To that end, my goals for this year are:</p>
<ul class="pl-8 post-ul"><li>To strengthen my intuition for solving data-based problems with time-efficient algorithms</li><li>To cement the core concepts around Pythonic data structures in my knowledgebase</li><li>To become more comfortable with Git/GitHub, in particular its command line interface and the branch/merge/HEAD flow</li><li>To complete each challenge on the day it's issued</li></ul>
<p class="post-p">Because nobody needs their RSS feed flooded by me every day for a month, I think I've found a way to start a blog post on, say, December 1st, update it every day for a week, then only push to the RSS feed on the 7th - so if you want to check on them daily, you can go to the actual factual blog, or just wait for the summary posts to come out.</p>
<p class="post-p">If you're just interested in the code (or are reading this from the future) and want to see my solutions, I'll be posting the code <a href="https://github.com/JeffersGlass/codeadvent2020">over on GitHub</a>. I'm not going to be striving to be one of the first 100 people posting successes to each problem (<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard">for which there is a leaderboard</a>), I'm just solving these for me. And I encourage anyone out there looking to build their programming confidence to do the same!</p>
