<p class="post-p">This weekend, I had the pleasure of operating in the <a href="https://www.winterfieldday.com/">Winter Field Day 2022</a> ham radio event. The event, a volunteer run spinoff of the long-running <a href="http://www.arrl.org/field-day">ARRL Field Day</a> encourages operators to move their radios out in the the wider, chillier world. While the ARRL field day has an explicit emphasis on disaster preparedness and mobility, Winter Field Day is as much about having a fun contest in the middle of the colder months as it is about actual field deployment. At least, that's how it seemed to me.</p>
<p class="post-p">That said, I'm a sucker for an excuse to get out an operate in a park. So I opted to set up in the <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/dnr/Parks/Pages/DesPlaines.aspx">Des Plaines State Fish and Wildlife Area</a>, POTA park number <a href="https://pota.app/#/park/K-4120">K-4120</a>, and snag some activation counts while also participating in Field Day.  </p>
