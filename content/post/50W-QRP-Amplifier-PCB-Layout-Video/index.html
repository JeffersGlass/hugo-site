<p class="post-paragraph">This past weekend, I started on the process of laying out the <a href="https://jeff.glass/2018/07/14/50w-qrp-amplifier-first-demonstration/">50W QRP Amplifier project</a> as a PCB. Small PCBs can be remarkably inexpensive these days - $10-$15 for 5 pieces of say 4"x4", shipped in 2-3 weeks. I'm treating this amplifier project as a chance to experiment with different, similar FETs to learn about critical power MOSFET properties, and also as an opportunity to brush up my layout skills that I haven't used in awhile.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">As the first step of PCB design, I captured the schematic of the amplifier as built in <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview">AutoDesk Eagle</a>. I did this on a livestream on YouTube, the first time I've tried such a thing. It was great fun! <a href="http://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com">Kenneth W6KWF</a> stopped by to lend advice - he deals with prototype PCBs as part of his day job, though he has team members to do most of the actual layouts when needed. We've had a great deal of fun over the years, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS1XJ1OVwfs">building a cloud chamber</a> for seeing charged ions in high school.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Here's the full (2h45m!) livestream in all its glory! There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lymB7f_2LU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2h40m59s">recap and full-circuit overview at 2h41m</a> for those who want to see the final circuit.</p>
