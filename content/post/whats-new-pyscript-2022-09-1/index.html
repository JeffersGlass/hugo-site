<p class="post-p">PyScript version 2022.09.1 was just released, and just as we <a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/issues/337">lead dev Fabio Pliger said</a> in proposing the versioning scheme:</p>
<blockquote class="post-blockquote">"...An important aspect to keep in mind is that PyScript is still in its very early stages. So, we should highlight that the expectations should be that think can often break until we reach a level of maturity and stability."</blockquote>
<p class="post-p">And wow, are there a lot of new things in this version of PyScript. What's more, the default Pyodide runtime has been upgraded to the recently-released <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/0.21.1/usage/quickstart.html">version 21.1</a>, which itself provides many new features and improved functionality to PyScript.</p>
<p class="post-p">I want to specificically highlight new features, breaking changes, and neat behind-the-scenes work. The full details of what's changed are captured in the <a href="" class="bg-red-600">PyScript Release Notes</a></p>
