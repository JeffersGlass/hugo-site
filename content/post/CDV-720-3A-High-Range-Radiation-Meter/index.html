<p class="post-paragraph">I went to the WCRA Hamfest in St. Charles this weekend in search of test gear (I had been fortunate to find a working <a href="https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/heath_digital_frequency_counte.html">Heathkit IM-2420 Frequency Counter</a> there a couple years ago).

<p class="post-paragraph">This beaut is a CDV-720 3A High Range Radiation Meter. It's a remnant of the early cold war, the beginning of the atomic age - thousands were produced in the late fifties and early sixties by the <a href="http://national-radiation-instrument-catalog.com/new_page_26.htm">Victoreen Company</a> out of Cleveland Ohio. It's got a cast aluminum case that feels like it's made to survive a bomb, and maybe it was. The manual notes that:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p class="post-paragraph"><em>It is designed to be used by radiological Civil Defense personnel in determining radioactive contamination levels that may result form an enemy attack or other nuclear disaster.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="post-paragraph">The really staggering thing about this meter is the range it covers: up to 500 Roentgens/hr. At that rate, your goose is cooked in a matter of minutes (first metaphorically, then literally).</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"> Here's a brief video overview of the meter, its circuitry, and the scary-high levels of radiation that it's meant to measure:</p>
