<p class="post-p">With the shell 3D-printed and the PCB assembled, I went ahead and put together my first "completed" mini-moving light, live on camera:</p>

<p class="post-p"></p></div></figure>
<p class="post-p">It went fairly well - everything mostly worked and nothing caught fire!</p>
<p class="post-p">There are a few mechanical and electrical takeaways for the next version, including:</p>
<ul class="post-ul"><li>Mechanical:<ul class="post-ul"><li>Ennlarge the hole for LED wires in the lower case</li><li>Make a brief instruction manual for myself of what needs to be assembled/installed/solder in what order</li><li>Hole for program/enable switch access</li><li>Fix tolerances on the tilt-servo/yoke interface</li><li>Lengthen the body to accommodate a heatsink for the LED star</li><li>Figure out mounting/hanging hardware</li></ul></li><li>Electrical:<ul class="post-ul"><li>Increase the spacing between Pan and Tilt Servo pads</li><li>Order higher-current 5V regulator (1.5A 7805)</li><li>Select a new inductor for up to 1A of current</li><li>Select a new schottky diode for up to 24V</li><li>Combine the transmit/receive control lines onto a single pin of the Arduino.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p class="post-p">But all in all, for a first assembly, even tripping over a couple of silly mistakes on my part, things went pretty well. Onward to V0.4.</p>
