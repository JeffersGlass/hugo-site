<h2 class="post-h2">PyCon 2023 Slides</h2>
<p class="post-p">At the PyScript tutorial at PyConUS on Wednesday April 19, 2023, I had the privilege to present two short sections of slides: one on Python/JS interoperability, and one on Event Handling. The slides for these sessions, as presented, are included below.</p>
<p class="post-p">The slides are created in <a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a> using a 2D layout, i.e. slide progression is both vertical and horizontal. The 'chapters' run left-to-right like a typical slide show, with detail slides running down from each chapter heading. Observe the arrows in the bottom right of the slides to see which directions the slides can move in. Hit escape to view an overview of all slides.</p>
