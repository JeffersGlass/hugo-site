<h2 class="post-h3">Installation</h2>
<p class="post-p">I'll start by install <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/devtools#vue-devtools" class="">the Node Devtools Chrome extension</a> as recommended in the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html">Node Installation Instructions</a>. Since I'm interested, in a new Git repo I'll run <code class="bg-gray-200 code">npm install -g @vue/cli</code>, which installs 947 packages and audits 949 packages in 30 seconds on my system.</p>
<p class="post-p">To actually create a new project to work on, I'll use the very simple <code>vue create hello-world</code> command. This does a whooole lot of things to set up a Vue environment, it seems, and I'll mostly stick with the Vue3 defaults. I'm assuming I can add in features like the router, VueX (for state management, I understand), and CSS preprocessors as I need them. What I end up with is a new 'hello-world' folder inside my proejct with a bunch of things in it:</p>

<p class="post-p">So. We get:</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
    <li>A node-modules folder with a ton of modules that are installed for us, as well as a package.json and package-lock.json with their requirements.</li>
    <li>A public folder, with just a favicon and index.html at this point.</li>
    <li>A src folder, with /assets and /components folders, as well as an App.vue and a main.js file. Presumably we'll be doing most of our work in here.</li>
    <li>A bunch of dotfiles for linting and babel configuration</li>
    <li>A pre-populated README.md file describing basing commands for running with npm.</li>
<p class="post-p">As this last file tells us, if we run <code class="code">npm run serve</code>, we should be able to see our new site on the provided IP address (http://localhost:8080). And we do!</p>

<p class="post-p">Well that wasn't too bad.</p>
