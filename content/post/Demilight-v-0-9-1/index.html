<p class="post-paragraph">The Demilight (miniature moving light) project has been slowed down in the past few months, mostly by good things. Namely, my return to my fulltime job and other interesting technical nerdery. But the project soldiers on!</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">I made a video detailing the trials and tribulations of getting version 0.9.1 built, which you can watch below (embedded) or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-ZiBg6NIeI">over on YouTube</a>.</p>
