<p class="post-">With the <a href="post/whats-new-pyscript-2023-11-1">2023.11.1 release</a> of PyScript behind us, i.e. the "break the world" release, the PyScript team is looking to push out releases more frequently. We're hoping to integrate both quality-of-life and significant feature improvements at a faster pace, and to push out realeases to match.</p>
<p class="post-p">With that, today PyScript released <a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/releases/tag/2023.11.2">version 2023.11.2</a>!</p>
<p class="post-p">It's worth remembering at this point that PyScript uses the <a href="https://calver.org/">CalVer</a> versioning system, where the parts of the version are YEAR.MONTH.RELEASE-NUMBER. That is, <span class="italic">there is no minor version component</span> of the release number, and all releases should be treated as potentially breaking. Given the speed at which PyScript is moving (and heck, the whole thing just got re-written from scratch), the versioning system accurately reflects that fact that things are going to break and change all the time.</p>
<p class="post-p">That siad, there aren't too many terribly breaking things in this release - a <a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1857">better Error message when <code>input()</code> is used on the main thread</a> is a nice touch though. No, the biggest change is what's happening to <code>/latest</code>.</p>
<h2 class="post-h2">The <code>/latest</code> problem</h2>
<p class="post-p">PyScript has had, up to this point, several valid URLs that it can be fetched from. In order from oldest to most-bleeding-edge, they are</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
