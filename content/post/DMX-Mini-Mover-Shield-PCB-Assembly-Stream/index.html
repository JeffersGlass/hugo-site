<p class="post-p">Last night, as I started to assemble V0.3 of my <a href="https://jeff.glass/2019/05/20/arduino-pro-mini-dmx-shield/">DMX Mini-Mover Shield</a>, I thought it might be fun to switch on my webcam and stream the assembly live to the World Wide Web. What follows is about 80 minutes of unstructured benchwork, chatting about DMX, sACN, and circuitry, and a first test of the new LED dimming circuit. Will it light up, or will it go boom? Watch the video to find out:</p>
