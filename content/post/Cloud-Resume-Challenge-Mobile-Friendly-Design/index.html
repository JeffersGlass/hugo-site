<p class="post-paragraph">The site's coming along well now! But there's just one small problem - specifically, how the site looks on mobile devices, or even just devices smaller than fullscreen. In short, bad.</p>

<p class="post-img-caption">That design is just straight-up mobile antagonistic.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Thankfully, Chrome's dev tools have a very handy device toolbar that forces the sites dimensions to be that of any of a number of common mobile devices, or allows the user to set a custom screen size. It also enables things like touch/click to scroll, to allow a dev to get the feeling of what the site will be like on a mobile touchscreen. I say "get the feeling" because nothing will quite mimick the actual feeling of holding the site on your hand and interacting with it at arms length; this is more of a tool to explore layouts than UI.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">So, let's see how tailwindcss can handle mobile-responsive designs. It seems that I've actually being going at the framework somewhat backward from how tailwind thinks about attributes. Any css attributes that do not have a size selector (sm, md, lg, xl, or 2xl) apply to all sizes of page; any attributes that <span class="italic">do</span> have a selector will apply on <span class="italic">that screen size and above.</span> So, as I'm going back and shoehorning mobile-friendliness into my site, I'll mostly be applying size selectors (probably lg or xl) to my existing css attributes, then adding new, un-size-tagged attributes that are mobile-appropriate.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Let's start on the homepage (index.html). Even at reasonable large monitor sizes, like those found on quite compact laptops or uses in a larger-resolution setting, we start to see issues created by fixed-width elements and non-responsible flexboxes.</p>
