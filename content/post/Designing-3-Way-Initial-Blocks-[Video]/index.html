<p class="post-p">In my experimentsÂ  with Fusion360 recently and casting around for inspiration, I stumbled across my old copy of <a href="https://amzn.to/2EbvrQ9">Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</a>, which has a curious cover design consisting of two objects that cast shadows of three different letters along three different axes. In the following video, I look at the process of designing one of these shapes with arbitrary letters for 3D printing.</p>
