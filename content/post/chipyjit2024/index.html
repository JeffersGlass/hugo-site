<p>On May 17, 2024, I had the pleasure of delivering a talk, <span class="italic">The CPython Jit</span>, at <a href="https://www.chipy.org/">The Chicago Python Meetup Group   </a>. All of the slides, supporting details, links, repos, and live demos are available here.</p>

<h2 class="post-h2" id="slides">Slides</h2>
<p>Below are the slides presented along with the talk:</p>

Things are essentially the same, but somewhat more complex now. Starting from simpler days is probably best.</li>
