description: "Reflections on A Year of Open Source"

<p class="post-p">One year ago this week, PyScript burst onto the scene, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKfkCY7cmBQ">Peter Wang's</a> dynamite keynote at PyConUS 2022. Even before the video was generally available on YouTube, the buzz around the project <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31217337">on Hacker News</a> and elsewhere was tremendous, and the possibilities - even for a project that is vocally (and still) "in heavy Alpha" - were electrifying.</p>
<p class="post-p">So one year on, where are we? And by "we", I mean PyScript as a project and, also, me: Jeff Glass. Today I'd like to look at the major evolutionary steps of the project in the past year, as well as some personal reflections on my work with PyScript and the interesting questions that have floated across my path.</p>
