<p class="post-p">Another interesting question popped up on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/TynfPGRwda">PyScript Discord</a> this week:</p>
<blockquote class="post-blockquote">I've got a question regarding network requests. How to do I call an API without blocking the UI thread? Like in JS you can just give fetch a callback function to call when the backend responds. Is there an equivalent for pyscript?</blockquote>
<script defer src="https://pyscript.net/releases/2022.06.1/pyscript.js"></script>
<p class="post-p">This is a very reasonable question for someone used to the callback-oriented style of modern Javascript programming. Let's put together a practical example of cooperative multitasking with callbacks in Pyscript.</p>
<blockquote class="p-2 mx-6 my-4 italic text-green-800 bg-green-100">Note that this page will focus on cooperative multitasking within Python via coroutines; for multitasking by running Python scripts truly asynchronously in the browser, see Pyodide's documentation on <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/webworker.html?highlight=thread">Using Pyodide in a web worker</a>.</blockquote>
<p class="post-p">One thing to note is that, by default, Pyscript/Pyodide execute each script tag as its own coroutine, so <code class="code">await</code>ing in one script block will automatically allow other script blocks to continue execution. Consider the following two (nearly identical) snippets, which with no further work independently count upward:</p>
<div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
    {{< showcode "post/pyscript-futures/sleep_1.py" >}}
    {{< showcode "post/pyscript-futures/sleep_2.py" >}}
</div>
<py-script>
    {{< loadcode "post/pyscript-futures/sleep_1.py" >}}
</py-script>
<py-script>
    {{< loadcode "post/pyscript-futures/sleep_2.py" >}}
</py-script>
<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
    <div class="w-full my-4 md:w-1/2">
        <span class="text-sm text-gray-500">Output from sleep_1.py</span>
        <div class="h-auto text-base bg-green-100 border-2" id="output-1"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="w-full m-4 md:w-1/2">
        <span class="text-sm text-gray-500">Output from sleep_2.py</span>
        <div class="h-auto text-base bg-green-100 border-2" id="output-2"></div>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="post-p">So, with no particular care on our part, we have a certain amount of cooperative multitasking between scripts. But the question asker was specifically asking about callback functions, like Javascripts <code class="code">.then()</code> construct. For that, we'll need to dive a little deeper.</p>
<hr>
<p class="post-p">To make it easier to see when our code is blocking, we'll need some kind of system process or web call that takes awhile to return a result. We'll make use of the delightfully named <a href="https://deelay.me/">Deelay.me API</a> to cause a (roughly) 7 second delay in our API call. The call itself will be to <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/">JSON Placeholder</a>, a mocked-up API service for exactly this kind of testing. So our endpoint will look like:</p>
<div class="my-4">
{{< highlight python3 "linenos=false">}}
endpoint = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"
ms_delay = "7000"
delay_api = f"https://deelay.me/{ms_delay}/{endpoint}"
{{< /highlight >}}
</div>
<p class="post-p">Let's start with some code that does <span class="font-bold">not</span> allow multitasking: each step <span class="italic">awaits</span> on the results of the previous one, so nothing can happen while we're waiting for results. The statement <code class="code">await_output.write("This will not otuput until the results are in")</code>, predictably, isn't visible until our <code class="code">fetch()</code> resolves.</p>
<p class="post-p">(We'll have our code print <span class="italic">Starting to Fetch Results</span> immediately before the fetch happens, so we can differentiate between Pyscript/Pyodide's load time and the delayed fetch.)</p>
<py-script output="await-output">
    {{< loadcode "post/pyscript-futures/await_fetch.py" >}}
</py-script>
{{< showcode "post/pyscript-futures/await_fetch.py" >}}
<div class="my-4">
    <span class="text-sm text-gray-500">Output from await_fetch.py</span>
    <div class="h-auto text-base bg-green-100 border-2" id="await-output"></div>
</div>
<p class="post-p">So far, nothing new. But what if we want to keep doing things while our process works in the background?</p>
<p class="post-p">Pyscript exposes the underlying <code class="code">webloop</code> that Pyodide uses to run our different scripts as separate coroutines. We can use asyncio's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.create_future">create_future</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.create_task">create_task</a> functions to add and scheduel additional tasks within this loop.</p>
<p class="post-p">First, we'll define the function <code class="code">fetch_it()</code> that we wish to run as a new coroutine, and the function <code class="code">print_results()</code> we'd like to use as a callback. Note that the callback function will receive the future (presumably, the result of the resolved future) as a argument when the future resolves. <code class="code">functools.partial</code> can be useful here to add additional frozen arguemnts. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future.add_done_callback">documentation for add_done_callback()</a> has some info on this.</p>
<p class="post-p">With our two functions in hand, we'll use <code class="code">pyscript.loop</code> to access the event loop and <code class="code">create_task()</code> to schedule our function as a coroutine. Note the parentheses in <code class="code">create_task(fetch_it())</code> - <span class="font-bold">create_task</span> takes a corotine created by a function, not the function itself!</p>
<p class="post-p">Finally, <code class="code">add_done_callback()</code> to tell the event loop to run our <code class="code">print_results()</code> function our when our task is complete.</p>
<p class="post-p">To show off that we really can do other things in the meanwhile, we'll use a simple <code class="code">for</code> loop over <code class="code">itertools.count()</code> (which will count upward forever) to print out some text every second until our delayed fetch returns. We'll use an <code class="code">isinstance()</code> check to see if the Future created by <code class="code">create_task</code> has already resolved to a result or not, and if it hasn't, check whether it's <code class="code">done()</code>.</p>
<py-script output="future-output">
    {{< loadcode "post/pyscript-futures/future_fetch.py" >}}
</py-script>
{{< showcode "post/pyscript-futures/future_fetch.py" >}}
<div class="my-4">
    <span class="text-sm text-gray-500">Output from await_fetch.py</span>
<div class="h-auto bg-green-100 border-2" id="future-output"></div>
<p class="post-p">If all has gone wall, you should see that the code above has counted to (about) 7 seconds before returning some JSON. (You may need to refresh the page to see it live.)</p>
<p class="post-p">There's no reason we can't add multiple callback functions to a single piece coroutine, though if you're doing that regularly you might consider some kind of dispatcher function or other refactoring.</p>
<hr>
<p class="post-p">Some things to keep in mind:
    <ul class="post-ul">
        <li>By default, all Pyscript scripts (and coroutines) <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/index.html?highlight=thread#web-workers">run in a single thread</a> within the main browser thread - long running computations can make the UI unresponsitve. Cooperative multitasking within a single thread will not solve this.</li>
        <li>Breaking your code into additional coroutines may have some impacts on <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/keyboard-interrupts.html?highlight=thread">how Pyodide handles preemptive interrupts</a> - see the documentation if your use-case requires this.</li>
    </ul>
