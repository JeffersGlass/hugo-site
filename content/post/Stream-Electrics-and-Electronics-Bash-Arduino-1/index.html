<p class="post-p">This Sunday evening, March 22nd 2020 at 7pm Central time, I'll be hosting a <a href="https://youtu.be/H7LOfnseQ7o">livestreaming Introduction to Arduino over on YouTube</a>!</p>
<p class="post-p">We'll start from scratch installing the Arduino IDE software, then moving on to programming fundamentals, wiring to the Arduino and using a breadboard, and more. We should cover enough ground to be useful to absolute beginners and pro's alike.</p>
<p class="post-p">Grab a cold one and come join me live as we make stuff and learn things. Bring your projects, bring your questions, bring your ideas for what we should learn or talk about. Let's hang and talk about something other than hand washing. See you there.</p>
<p class="post-p">This page will be updated with links and resources following the stream.</p>
