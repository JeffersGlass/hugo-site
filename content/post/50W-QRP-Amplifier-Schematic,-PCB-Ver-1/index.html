<p class="post-paragraph">The 5W-to-50W QRP HF Amplifier project is rolling along nicely  - I received the first PCB draft in the male this week and am 90% of the way through assembling it, with only heatsink-placement left to sort out.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">I've made a couple of additions to the schematic since the original layout, including a relay-activated indicator (R27 and its LED) and an RF-output sensing LED (from C14 to its associated LED to ground) along the the lines of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ8YADOWk9U">VK3YE's recent project</a>. There's also a space on the PCB now for a low pass filter with the same footprint as <a href="https://www.qrp-labs.com/lpfkit.html">Hans Summers' LPFs over at QRP-Labs</a>. Not that you'd necessarily want to reuse a QRP LPF for a 50W amp, you'd be in danger of putting too much voltage on the caps, but that would be a simple change.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Here's the schematic as it exists now:</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">And here's the current boards (layout, unpopulated, populated):</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">I've already got a little laundry list of things to modify for a second rev of this board, including, in no particular order:</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>Swap the Diode placements the vertical to preserve board space</li>
<li>Add footprints for alternate relay packages</li>
<li>Add footprints for alternate trim-pot packages</li>
<li>Re-think component designators for clarity</li>
<li>Add bypass jumpers for the 3dB input pad and the LPF.</li>
<li>For some reason, the none of the component values printed on the silkscreen, will need to sort that out</li>
<li>I'm not sure if I screwed up how to designate a cutout or if JLCPCB doesn't do them for its bare-bones PCB service, but I'd like not to do the next set with a drill press and a nibbler.</li></ul>
<p class="post-paragraph">Hoping to put this on the air soon for some signal tests. Hear you there!</p>
