<p class="post-paragraph">I must have started half a dozen blogs in my life. I still maintain a separate one for Ham Radio at <a href="http://kk9jef.wordpress.com">KK9JEF.wordpress.com</a>. I'll have to see about transferring those posts to this site.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">So why another new blog? Two reasons:</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
<p class="post-paragraph"> <li>My blog at <a href="http://kk9jef.wordpress.com">KK9JEF.wordpress.com</a> was specifically for my Ham Radio projects and learnings. As my hobbies expand into other areas, I thought it might finally be time to have a general-purpose personal hobbyist blog.</li></p>
<p class="post-paragraph"> <li>I've always struggled to find the balance between blog posts that catalog a completed project in whole. For example, my entire K3NG Morse-Code Keyer Project was wrapped into one big post, but I split up my Beach 40 Build into multiple small sections. Neither is perfect - the "blog as you build" method leaves a somewhat scattered trail for those who come after and want to replicate what you did (which is sometimes you in the future), but the "wait until it's done" method means a lot of the process is undocumented.</li></p>
<p class="post-paragraph"></p></ul>
<p class="post-paragraph">To that end, this new site has both <a href="https://jeff.glass/blog/">BLOG</a> and <a href="https://jeff.glass/projects/">PROJECTS</a> sections - the blog can be for more single-shot observations, and the projects subpages can contain coherent descriptions of where a particular build or project is at.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">It's worth a shot!</p>
