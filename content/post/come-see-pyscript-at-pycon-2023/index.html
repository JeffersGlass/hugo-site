<p class="post-p">Pycon US is almost upon us! After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKfkCY7cmBQ">Peter Wang's dynamite keynote</a> launching PyScript at PyCon US 2022, the team is back again with a swath of interesting talks, tutorials, and topics in Salt Lake City this year. If you're interesting in PyScript, or Python on the web in any form, I'd highly encourage you to check these out.</p>
<h2 class="post-h2">PyScript Team Talks</h2>
<p class="post-p">The following are talks and tutorials being given by PyScript team members, on PyScript or related topics:</p>
<h3 class="post-h3">Tutorial: Writing Serverless Python Webb Apps with PyScript</h2>
{{< pycon23 date="Wednesday April 19, 2023. 1:30pm-5:00pm" room="250D" url="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/102/">}}
<p class="post-p">We'll be kicking off the week strong with a full tutorial sesion on PyScript, hosted by Engineering Manager Ted Patrick with contributions by several of the PyScript core team. We'll look at the fundamentals of PyScript, how to configure a PyScript page/app with all the resources it needs, how to respond to events, build and utilize plugins, and use PyScript to bring all the power of existing JavaScript libraries into the Python world. No shortage of exciting things to cover!</p>
<p class="post-p">I say "we" because I'm fortunate enough to be a part of the team presenting this session, in my own small way. If you want to learn more about PyScript, meet the team, or get involved, this would be a great session to attend. We'd love to see you there!</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">Talks: Build Yourself a PyScript</h2>
{{< pycon23 date="Friday April 21, 2023. 12:15pm-1:00pm" room="335ABC" url="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/27/">}}
<p class="post-p">PyScript team members Paul Everitt and Nicholas Tollervey will be taking a look at Python platforms on the web. If you were inventing a general-purpose Python platform that you wanted others to use and build upon, what considerations might you have for its API, format and function? What does a "file" mean in the context of a web page? How would "virtual environments" work? What is a Web Worker and why should you care?</p>
<p class="post-p">Both Nicholas and Paul are seasoned experts in plumbing these kinds of foundational questions in their talks - if you're thinking about building something with Python on the Web, whether <span class="italic">with</span> PyScript or <span class="italic">in place of</span> PyScript, this would be a great talk to visit.</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">Talks: The CPU in your browser: WebAssembly demystified</h2>
{{< pycon23 date="Saturday April 22, 2023. 12:15pm-12:45pm" room="225DEF" url="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/93/">}}
<p class="post-p">PyScript principle software engineer Antonio Cuni will be presenting on Web Assembly - what is it, what can it do, what <span class="italic">can't</span> it do, and what's coming in the future. The talk aims to go deeper than a simple "What is Web Asssembly?" to talk about advanced topics ike dynamic linking, JIT Compliation, the relationship with Emscripten, and more.</p>
<p class="post-p">Antonio's background in compilers and interpreters (in particular HPy and PyPy) gives him a great lens to view the underlying technology that underpins many of the Python-on-the-Web implementations that now exist, like PyScript and Pyodide.</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">Python on the Web</h2>
<p class="post-p">If you're reading this far, I'm going to assume you have some interest in Python On the Web as a topic; as such, here are a few more sessions that I think are exciting in that vein:</p>
