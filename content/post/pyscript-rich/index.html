        <p class="post-p">Though PyScript is still in its infancy, the possibilities unlocked by running Python in a browser are already blossoming. As such, I'm seeing more and more users on the <a href="https://community.anaconda.cloud/c/tech-topics/pyscript/41">official forums</a>, the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/TynfPGRwda">unofficial Discord</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript">Github Issue Tracker</a> interested in working with their favorite libraries to the web. Let's look at the process of taking a package that <span class="italic">runs</span> but doesn't run <span class="italic">well</span>, and see how we can use patch it after import to bring it to life using Pyscript.</p>
        <p class="post-p">Lots of packages work fine right out of the box - anything <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/loading-packages.html#loading-packages">written in Pure Python stands a good chance of at least running</a>. But just because it runs, doesn't mean it'll look good or behave the way we expect objects to on a webpage. Interactive packages, like <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> or terminal-based packages like <a href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm">tqdm</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tartley/colorama">colorama</a>, may not be immediately interactable in the browser, because they've implemented their own methods for interpretting input/output that the browser doesn't play nicely with. Just because the PyScript/Pyodide interpretter doesn't crash doesn't mean you can get useful info in and out of an existing module.</p>
        <p class="post-p">One such library is <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich">Rich</a>: "a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal" by Will McGugan. It allows for tasteful pretty-printing of most Python objects, syntax highlighting, color and layout control and more, all written in Pure Python. See the sample image to the side or the linked homepage for bountiful exmaples.</p>
        <p class="post-p">Of course, Rich is intended to run in the terminal. Since the display functionality in a web browser differs significantly from a terminal environment, there's no reason to expect it will work out of the box in PyScript. But since it exists as a pure Python wheel and is importable by Pyodide, I wanted to see what it would take to get it working.</p>
        <p class="post-p">What follows is the result of a few hours of bashing things together. It's not meant to be production ready (thought it could turn into a module if there's interest). Rather, it's meant to demonstrate a patching strategy for modules that already integrate with web-Python environments like Jupyter and iPython.</p>
        <p class="post-p">If you want to skip the dev log, you can skip to <a href="patch">the code that runs to patch Rich on this page </a> or the <a href="#examples">gallery of Rich-in-PyScript samples</a> below.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="post-h2">The Groundwork</h2>
<p class="post-p">The strategy we'll employ to get Rich working is called "Monkeypatching." <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120730014107/http://wiki.zope.org/zope2/MonkeyPatch">From the Zope Wiki</a>:</p>
<p class="p-2 mx-6 mb-4 italic bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-800">A MonkeyPatch is a piece of Python code which extends or modifies other code at runtime (typically at startup)...The motivation for monkeypatching is typically that the developer needs to modify or extend behavior of a third-party product ... and does not wish to maintain a private copy of the source code.</p>
<p class="post-p">So, we'll be loading/importing Rich <span class="italic">as-is</span>, modifying some of the attributes/methods/behaviors of its classes and functions and leaving others along. This will let us preserve the most of Rich's functionality untouched, while tweaking it just enough to work inside PyScript.</p>
<p class="post-p">Almost all of the heavy lifting in terms of the formatting is handled by the fact Rich <a href="https://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/tech/post/rich-adds-support-for-jupyter-notebooks/">already supports Jupyter Notebooks</a>, so there's already translation in place to translate Rich's internal formatting syntax to HTML. All we have to do is:</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
    <li>Import rich (which means it'll need to be present in our <code class="code">&lt;py-env&gt;</code>  </li>
    <li>Hook into or replace the code that detects that we're running in a Notebook to instead tell that we're running inside Pyodide.</li>
    <li>Take the output that would be fed to the notebook and feed it to <code class="code">stdout</code>, where PyScript's context managers will get it to the right place</li>
    <li>Overwrite the built-in <code class="code">print()</code> function to point to rich's print function, to get nicely formatted printing</li>
    <li>Point PyScript's <code class="code">Element.write()</code> method at a new method that hooks into Rich's __rich_console__ and <code class="code">__rich__</code> formatting methods.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="post-h2">The Steps</h2>
<h4 class="post-h4">Making Rich Think We're in a Jupyter Notebook</h3>
<p class="post-p">Since we're intending to run this in a browser anyway, we could just set <code class="code">console.is_jupyter = True</code> to force Rich to render HTML. But we'll be slightly nicer and redirect that property to a new function <code class="code">is_pyodide</code>. This just looks to see if 'pyodide' is in our available modules, <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/faq.html#how-to-detect-that-code-is-run-with-pyodide">as suggested by the pyodide FAQ</a>. This means that whenever our code is running in Pyodide, the Rich library will render as if it's going to be output to a Jupyter notebook.</p>
<div class="mb-6 lg:mx-4">
{{< highlight python "linenostart=9" >}}
# Per pyodide docs, determine if we're running inside pyodide at Runtime
def is_pyodide() -> bool:
    return "pyodide" in modules
 
# Patch jupyter detection of the global _console object to detect pyodide
c = get_console()
c.is_jupyter = is_pyodide #monkeypatch jupyter detection @propety

# patch function so if user creates any additional Consoles they behave correctly
# While the global _console us
_is_jupyter = is_pyodide
{{< /highlight >}}
</div>
<h4 class="post-h4">Replacing Rich's Display Function with our Own</h4>
<p class="post-p">Similarly, we'll point <code class="code">rich.jupyter.display</code> at a new function we'll write that gets the output that the Jupyter notebook would have received and send it to stdout. And, as noted above, we'll redirect the usual <code class="code">print</code> function to the rich print function, to get nicely formatted outputs whenever we use the standard print() syntax.</p>
<div class="mb-6 lg:mx-4">
{{< highlight python "linenostart=16" >}}
# Jupyter display method renders html and writes to stdout
def display_pyscript(segments: Iterable[Segment], text: str) -> None:
    """Allow output of raw HTML within pyscript/pyodide"""
    html = rich.jupyter._render_segments(segments)
    stdout.write(html)

#patch jupyter display method to write processed HTML to stdout
rich.jupyter.display = display_pyscript 

print = get_console().print
{{< /highlight >}}
</div>
<h4 class="post-h4">Fixing <span class="italic">Element.write()</span></h4>
<p class="post-p">Finally, we need to match some adjustments to PyScript's <code class="code">Element.write()</code> function, which is a utility method that allows PyScript users to send output to a specific DOM element directly. Since this bypasses the usual writing to stdout (and directly modifies the <span class="italic">innerHTML</span> attribute of the DOM element), we need to do a little legwork to get the formatting to work.</p>
<p class="post-p">In a nutshell, we'll solve this issue in 3 steps:
    <ul class="post-ul">
        <li>When the user's code calls to <code class="code">Element.write()</code>, if the object written is a plain <code>str</code>, <code>Exception</code>, or <code>JsException</code>, we'll pass it though to <code class="code">Element.write()</code> unchanged. This preserves some of the functionality around how PyScript currrently does error handling and presentation.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, we'll use a context manager to temporarily redirect <code>stdout</code> to a buffer, feed the object to <code class="code">rich.console.print()</code>, and capture that output in the buffer.</li>
        <li>When the context manager closes, it writes its contents to the appropriate element using the original <code class="code">Element.write()</code> functionality.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="post-p"> I've implemented a rudementary <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object">File-like object</a> called <code class="code">output_buffer</code> that simply saves anything written to it as a concatenated string. If this isn't the first thing in the buffer, we insert a <code class="code">&lt;br&gt;</code> tag to make it start on a new line. This is admittedly a hack, but it largely gives the right appearance.</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">What About ...</h2>
<p class="post-p">Those who are familiar with the various ways Rich already provides to capture its own output, as well as exporting it as HTML, may have some reasonable questions here. It's surely possible I've missed something in Rich's expansive API, but I didn't find a solution that did everything I want without implementing my own context manager. That said, it does feel like there shuold be a simpler way...</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
    <li>I wanted to make the default console returned by <code class="code">get_console()</code> have the desired behavior, as well as any consoles the user created in the future. Hence the reason for overriding the _is_jupyter method instead of just making the default console <code class="code">force_jupyter=True</code></li>
    <li>Using <code class="code">Console.capture()</code> captures the entire contents of the console, from which it can be exported (or saved as a file) to HTML, but there isn't a direct way to save just the use-input-turned-into-HTML as far as I know.</li>
    <li>Because <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich/blob/8e2da1afab8743d8e3c55b8191492cc5f9905b7f/rich/jupyter.py#L84-L95">Rich's jupyter.display() method</a> tries specifically to write to an iPython display, I needed to override this method to render the objects to HTML and just write those to std.</li>
</ul>
<p class="post-p">With all these pieces put together, now most writes to standard out should be formatted using Rich's format rules.</p>
<h2 class="post-h2">What Works and What Doesn't</h2>
<p class="italic post-p">See the <a href="#examples">demos below</a> for working (and non-working) examples.</p>
<p class="post-p">Out of the box, this allows for formatting of most static Rich objects: Text, Lists and Dicts, JSON objets, etc. The various formatting objects that rely on them - Panels, Columns, Layouts etc - also work.</p>
<p class="line-through post-p">What breaks, however, is anything that uses threading under the hood to operate: live-updating displays, progress bars, that sort of thing. Since <a href="https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/237">threading isn't currently supported in Pyodide</a>, there's not much of a direct solution here, but some workarounds can be had by using <span class="italic">async-await</span> to concurrently update the state of these objects. Check out the <a href="#progress-bar">progress-bar demo</a> below for an example.</p>
<p class="px-2 mx-4 bg-gray-200 border-l-4 border-gray-800 post-p">Since writing the above, I've (almost) completed work on implementing a version of the <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/live.html">Rich Live class</a> using pyodide's event loop and async/await instead of threads. That work is detailed in a separate post (coming soon), but there are some previews on twitter in the meantime: <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JeffersGlass/status/1559634350513299456?s=20&t=qHo-w2VcStd_-fWLtSdotQ">[1]</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JeffersGlass/status/1559671709250342917?s=20&t=qHo-w2VcStd_-fWLtSdotQ">[2]</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JeffersGlass/status/1559682257312423937?s=20&t=qHo-w2VcStd_-fWLtSdotQ">[3]</a>. I've left the examples below that using async/await directly as an example of what you might do if you want to manage updates more manually.</p>
<p class="post-p">Emoji are also (somewhat) broken, though that's mostly through me running out of time to look at their implementation in depth. A brief glance at the <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich/blob/master/rich/emoji.py">Emoji.py source</a> makes it look like perhaps what I'm doing for output is clobbering the unicode characters that should be output as Emoji? Or perhaps how they're being rendered - the TL;DR example at the top of the page shows (for me) a successful "hand-pointing-down" but a non-colored "play button".</p>
