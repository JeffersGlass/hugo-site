<p class="post-p">One thing I'd like to have for both my <a href="project/demilight">Demilight project page</a> and the homepage is an automatically generated gallery of thumbnails of my recent YouTube uploads, either from a specific playlist or from all of my uploads. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be a straightfoward thing to do with YouTube's built-in embedding tools. But perhaps we can figure out a way to do so using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3">YouTube Data Api</a>.</p>
<p class="post-p">As one might guess from my approach to the <a href="tags/codeadvent">Advent of Code challenges</a>, my preferred langauge for bashing together solutions like this is Python. So I'll be following the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python">Python Quickstart Guide</a> for the YouTube Data API to see if that gets me anywhere.
