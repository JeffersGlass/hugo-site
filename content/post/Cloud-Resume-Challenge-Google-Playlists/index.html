<p class="post-p">One thing I'd like to have for both my <a href="project/demilight">Demilight project page</a> and the homepage is an automatically generated gallery of thumbnails of my recent YouTube uploads, either from a specific playlist or from all of my uploads. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be a straightfoward thing to do with YouTube's built-in embedding tools. But perhaps we can figure out a way to do so using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3">YouTube Data Api</a>.</p>
<p class="post-p">As one might guess from my approach to the <a href="tags/codeadvent">Advent of Code challenges</a>, my preferred langauge for bashing together solutions like this is Python. So I'll be following the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python">Python Quickstart Guide</a> for the YouTube Data API to see if that gets me anywhere.</p>
<p class="post-p">Since I prefer to work inside a pipenv, I'll start by running <code class="code">pipenv install google-api-python-client --python 3.10</code> and <code class="code">pipenv install google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2</code> to get the prerequisite libraries set up.</p>
<p class="post-p">On the Google Cloud Platform API page, I'll click the project button at the top and create a new project called "hugo-youtube-playlists". In the library panel, I'll enable the YouTube Data API v3 for this new project as well.</p>
<p class="post-p">The next step, creating an oauth2 clientID, is a a bit more involved, as I first need to configure my consent screen.</p>

<p class="post-p">And since I'm not a <span class="italic">Google Workspace User</span>, I can apparently only create "External" apps, which means I'll have to manually add users to the list of tes users who can use my app... which should be fine, since the only user will be me, I expect.</p>

<p class="post-p">The settings for creating a consent screen don't seem to arduous, and most are optional besides the application name and some contact email information. The only scope I expect the app to need access to is read-only access to the YouTube Data API v3; thankfully, the filtering function on the 34-pages of possible scopes helps find that.</p>
