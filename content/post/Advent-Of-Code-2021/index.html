<p class="post-p">Is it Advent of Code time again? Well, here goes nothing. Let's see wha we can cook up.</p>
<p class="post-p">I'm planning on completing most (all) of this year's challenges in Python, <a href="/post/advent-of-code-2020/">same as last year</a>.</p>

<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 1</h4>
<p class="post-p">I feel like it's Advent of Code tradition for me to read in the input from file (as strings) and try to do comparisons on it like ints, forgetting to cast them to intergers. Which means I was comparing textually, instead of numerically, so my answer was off by <span class="italic">two</span>. Absurd. </p>
<p class="post-p">You really could do <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1">today's challenge</a> entirely in one line, but I think it's slightly more readable broken up as I've done. Here's the complete code:</p>
<p class="code-title">Day1/Part1.py</p>
{{< highlight python3 "hl_lines=2">}}
with open("input.txt", "r") as infile:
    data = [int(t) for t in infile.read().split('\n')]

numDecreases = len([pair for pair in zip(data[:-1], data[1:]) if pair[0] < pair[1]])

print(f"{numDecreases=}")
{{< /highlight >}}
<p class="post-img-caption">The offending line, where I remembered to cast the input to ints.</p>
<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 mt-4 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 2</h4>
<p class="post-p">Part 2 could also probably be inlined, but the list-comprehension-within-list-comprehension is, again, not the most readable thing, I think. Breaking out the three key steps (creating triples of the data, finding their sums, and finding where adjacent sums are decreasing) into 3 lines of code I think makes the solution more parsable.</p>
<p class="code-title">Day1/Part2.py</p>
{{< highlight python3 >}}
with open("input.txt", "r") as infile:
    data = [int(t) for t in infile.read().split('\n')]

triples = zip(data[:-2], data[1:-1], data[2:])
windowSums = [sum(list(t)) for t in triples]

numDecreases = len([t for t in zip(windowSums[:-1], windowSums[1:]) if t[0] < t[1]])

print(f"{numDecreases=}")

<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 1</h4>
<p class="post-p">The first part of today's challenge has us dealing with a list of things that happen sequentially (tracking the horizontal and vertical movements of our submarine), but the answer only has to do with summing them in some specific ways. This smells strongly of a 'gotcha' coming in part 2 - if we can the easy, just-sum-it-up route for part 1, we won't be able to reuse any code for part 2 when the order actually matters. But that's alright, I guess, we'll take the easy route on this one.</p>
<p class="post-p">There's a fair amount of repetition in my list comprehensions here, but for a 7-line program I don't terribly feel like factoring it out.</p>
<p class="code-title">Day2/Part1.py</p>
{{< highlight python3 >}}
with open("input.txt", 'r') as infile:
    # data is a list of tuples; each tuple is of form ('instruction', int) where 'instruction' is forward, down, up
    data = [(line.split(' ')[0], int(line.split(' ')[1])) for line in infile.read().split('\n')]

horizontal = sum([step[1] for step in data if step[0] == 'forward'])
depth = sum([step[1] for step in data if step[0] == 'down']) - sum([step[1] for step in data if step[0] == 'up'])
print(f"Solution product is {horizontal * depth =}")
{{< /highlight >}}
<h4 class="pb-1 mt-4 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 2</h4>
<p class="post-p">As expected, we're paying the (small) price for not doing the first part iteratively. That's alright, we can implement it now.</p>
<p class="post-p">This does give me a chance to play with a new feature of Python 3.10: structural pattern matching. It's like a switch-case structure on steroids. To make sure I'm running this code in Python 3.10 specifically, I'll use pipenv to lock the version to 3.10.0 by running <code class="code">pipenv install --python 3.10</code> on the command line.</p>
<p class="post-p">Our code is ultimately fairly simple; thankfully, I encountered no "unmatched instruction" errors, which means I parsed the input correctly.</p>

<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 1</h4>
<p class="post-p">Ah, day 3 of Advent of Code, where we traditionally get into nested-processing, working with binary, and parsing numbers based on their digits. I don't know that this literally happens on day 3 every year, but it seems a familiar progression in the early days of an Advent of Code challenge. My first thought is - let's make sure we iterate through the entire input as few times as possible, something made easier by the fact that epsilon and gamma are, in some sense, complements of each other.</p>
<p class="post-p">This one's not too hard - using a <code class="code">defaultdict</code> from the <code class="code">collections</code> module makes the process of adding up the number of "1"'s in all the input numbers a little cleaner.</p>
<p class="code-title">Day3/Part1.py</p>
{{< highlight python3 >}}
from collections import defaultdict

with open("input.txt", 'r') as infile:
    data = infile.read().split('\n')

numInputs = len(data)
onesCount = defaultdict(lambda: 0)

#Count the number of "1"'s at each digit position in all of the input numbers
for num in data:
    for i, digit in enumerate(num):
        onesCount[i] += int(digit)

#Calculate gamma, epison as lists of strings ("1" and "0")
gamma = [("1" if onesCount[i] > (numInputs / 2) else "0") for i in range(len(onesCount))]
epsilon = [("1" if gamma[i] == "0" else "0") for i in range(len(onesCount))]

#Concatenate lists, as 0b to represent binary, cast to int
result = int('0b' + ''.join(gamma), 2) * int('0b' + ''.join(epsilon), 2)
print(f"{gamma= } {epsilon= } {result= }")

<p class="post-p">Now we're moving into the realm of processing some input data with multiple passes, while restricting which data is in each pass based on our processing of previous steps. My initial solution was a little cumbersome, but I think gets the intention accross pretty well. </p>

<p class="post-p">We can refactor this a bit, so that the logic of reducing the list of input values is done in a function called <code class="code">calculateRating</code>, which takes a list of data as well as a function. The function tells us, for a given digit position, what value at that position should be used to keep values in our data for our next round of culling.</p>
<p class="post-p">While we could also get a little fancy and combine <code class="code">mostCommonDigitInPosition</code> and <code class="code">leastCommonDigitInPosition</code>, I think we'd actually be in danger of making things <span class="italic">too</span> concise. The difference between <code class="code">>=</code> and <code class="code">></code> in each case is critical, and I think factoring that out might be too reductive.</p>

<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 1</h4>
<p class="post-p">Today my biggest obstacle was, as is often the case, myself trying to be too clever and concise. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4">Today's challenge</a> invovled parsing a somewhat more involved text file of inputs, and then further processing that input to make it into a useful data structure. Rather than load each bingo card as a 2D array, I used the input data to create two separate arrays, one indexed by rows, the other by columns, with boards at the same position representing the same board. Determining whether a board is winning (given a list of called numbers) is a simple as asking whether any of the lines (rows or columns) in that board have all their members in the called numbers.</p>
<p class="post-p">Had I simply constructed each type of input using <code class="code">for</code> loops, this would have been fairly simply, but I wanted everything packaged up nice in a list comprehension... which took me a spell to troubleshoot and get right. Ah well.</p>

<p class="post-p">One of the gotchas on this day is making incorrect assumptions about the ordering of points in a given line. For eaxmple, for a line with endpoints (3,5) and (3,0), doing something like: <code class="code">for y in range(point1.y, point2.y)</code> will generate exactly one point <code class="code">(3.5)</code>, because the ending y coordinate is less than the starting one. This can be fixed by either ranging over the values in a consistent direction (always from lesser to great, say) or by pre-sorting the line coordinates so that the first coordinate is always less than the second for the given axis. I chose to do the former.</p>
<p class="post-p">Unrelatedly, I'm personally a fan of <a href="https://regex101.com/">Regex101</a> for working out regexes. It makes the process of fleshing out a given pattern visual and intuitive, and the built-in reference guides and regex tips are invaluable.</p>

That is, I swapped the endpoints of each diagonal line as necessary to ensure the point with the lower X coordinate was first. Then, if the second y coordinate is great  than the first, each time we increase the x coordinate by 1, we will by definition incrase the y coordinate by 1.
