<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 1</h4>
<p class="post-p">I feel like it's Advent of Code tradition for me to read in the input from file (as strings) and try to do comparisons on it like ints, forgetting to cast them to intergers. Which means I was comparing textually, instead of numerically, so my answer was off by <span class="italic">two</span>. Absurd. </p>
<p class="post-p">You really could do <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1">today's challenge</a> entirely in one line, but I think it's slightly more readable broken up as I've done. Here's the complete code:</p>
<p class="code-title">Day1/Part1.py</p>
{{< highlight python3 "hl_lines=2">}}
with open("input.txt", "r") as infile:
    data = [int(t) for t in infile.read().split('\n')]

numDecreases = len([pair for pair in zip(data[:-1], data[1:]) if pair[0] < pair[1]])

print(f"{numDecreases=}")
{{< /highlight >}}
<p class="post-img-caption">The offending line, where I remembered to cast the input to ints.</p>
<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 mt-4 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 2</h4>
<p class="post-p">Part 2 could also probably be inlined, but the list-comprehension-within-list-comprehension is, again, not the most readable thing, I think. Breaking out the three key steps (creating triples of the data, finding their sums, and finding where adjacent sums are decreasing) into 3 lines of code I think makes the solution more parsable.</p>
<p class="code-title">Day1/Part2.py</p>

<p class="post-p">The first part of today's challenge has us dealing with a list of things that happen sequentially (tracking the horizontal and vertical movements of our submarine), but the answer only has to do with summing them in some specific ways. This smells strongly of a 'gotcha' coming in part 2 - if we can the easy, just-sum-it-up route for part 1, we won't be able to reuse any code for part 2 when the order actually matters. But that's alright, I guess, we'll take the easy route on this one.</p>
<p class="post-p">There's a fair amount of repetition in my list comprehensions here, but for a 7-line program I don't terribly feel like factoring it out.</p>

<p class="post-p">As expected, we're paying the (small) price for not doing the first part iteratively. That's alright, we can implement it now.</p>
<p class="post-p">This does give me a chance to play with a new feature of Python 3.10: structural pattern matching. It's like a switch-case structure on steroids. To make sure I'm running this code in Python 3.10 specifically, I'll use pipenv to lock the version to 3.10.0 by running <code class="code">pipenv install --python 3.10</code> on the command line.</p>
<p class="post-p">Our code is ultimately fairly simple; thankfully, I encountered no "unmatched instruction" errors, which means I parsed the input correctly.</p>

<p class="post-p">Ah, day 3 of Advent of Code, where we traditionally get into nested-processing, working with binary, and parsing numbers based on their digits. I don't know that this literally happens on day 3 every year, but it seems a familiar progression in the early days of an Advent of Code challenge. My first thought is - let's make sure we iterate through the entire input as few times as possible, something made easier by the fact that epsilon and gamma are, in some sense, complements of each other.</p>
<p class="post-p">This one's not too hard - using a <code class="code">defaultdict</code> from the <code class="code">collections</code> module makes the process of adding up the number of "1"'s in all the input numbers a little cleaner.</p>

for num in data:
    for i, digit in enumerate(num):

epsilon = [("1" if gamma[i] == "0" else "0") for i in range(len(onesCount))]

#Concatenate lists, as 0b to represent binary, cast to int
result = int('0b' + ''.join(gamma), 2) * int('0b' + ''.join(epsilon), 2)

<p class="post-p">We can refactor this a bit, so that the logic of reducing the list of input values is done in a function called <code class="code">calculateRating</code>, which takes a list of data as well as a function. The function tells us, for a given digit position, what value at that position should be used to keep values in our data for our next round of culling.</p>
<p class="post-p">While we could also get a little fancy and combine <code class="code">mostCommonDigitInPosition</code> and <code class="code">leastCommonDigitInPosition</code>, I think we'd actually be in danger of making things <span class="italic">too</span> concise.

<p class="post-p">Today my biggest obstacle was, as is often the case, myself trying to be too clever and concise. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4">Today's challenge</a> invovled parsing a somewhat more involved text file of inputs, and then further processing that input to make it into a useful data structure. Rather than load each bingo card as a 2D array, I used the input data to create two separate arrays, one indexed by rows, the other by columns, with boards at the same position representing the same board. Determining whether a board is winning (given a list of called numbers) is a simple as asking whether any of the lines (rows or columns) in that board have all their members in the called numbers.</p>
<p class="post-p">Had I simply constructed each type of input using <code class="code">for</code> loops, this would have been fairly simply, but I wanted everything packaged up nice in a list comprehension... which took me a spell to troubleshoot and get right. Ah well.</p>

<p class="post-p">One of the gotchas on this day is making incorrect assumptions about the ordering of points in a given line. For eaxmple, for a line with endpoints (3,5) and (3,0), doing something like: <code class="code">for y in range(point1.y, point2.y)</code> will generate exactly one point <code class="code">(3.5)</code>, because the ending y coordinate is less than the starting one. This can be fixed by either ranging over the values in a consistent direction (always from lesser to great, say) or by pre-sorting the line coordinates so that the first coordinate is always less than the second for the given axis. I chose to do the former.</p>
<p class="post-p">Unrelatedly, I'm personally a fan of <a href="https://regex101.com/">Regex101</a> for working out regexes. It makes the process of fleshing out a given pattern visual and intuitive, and the built-in reference guides and regex tips are invaluable.</p>

<p class="post-p">Having selected to iterate over the points in a line in a consistent way in the first half, I felt it might be easier to pre-process the diagonal lines in the second half. That is, I swapped the endpoints of each diagonal line as necessary to ensure the point with the lower X coordinate was first. Then, if the second y coordinate is great  than the first, each time we increase the x coordinate by 1, we will by definition incrase the y coordinate by 1. If the second y coordinate is less than the first, y decreased by 1 for each increase of the x coordinate.

<p class="post-p">Part one of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6">today's puzzle</a> was deceptively simple. It asks the challenger to calculate the number of lanternfish present after a given number of steps of an iterative process. The way the puzzle's data is displayed in the examples presented, one might be tempted to keep the data as a long list of individual fish listed by the number of days till they next reproduce; then, for each step, iterate over the list and take the appropriate action. While this shold generate a solution, the list would quickly balloon out of the control. The key insight is that each fish that will, say, generate a new fish in 4 days, is identical to every other fish that will spawn a new fish in four days. So really, we don't need to track individual fish, just the total count of fish that will reproduce in a given number of days. For every day that passes, each of those counts of fish reduce their count by one, and we do some special accounting to the fish that are reproducing today, and iterate.</p>
<p class="post-p">This quick and simple approach does make one worry that part 2 will require more convoluted reasoning though.</p>

<p class="post-p">Ah! We've gotten lucky here and avoided the 'gotcha' that the puzzle writer was thinking of. The second step asks to calculate the number of fish present after 256 steps; if one had taken the "process the whole list" technique in part one, one would be screwed in part two as the exponential growth of the fish population really takes off. But with a condensed, iterative process like we used in part 1, one only has to change the <code class="code">daysToRun</code> value to 256, and our answer pops out in less than a quarter of a second! Excellent. I'm not even going to include the code a second time, since it is <span class="italic">identical to part 1 except for the value of <code class="code">daysToRun</code></span>.</p>

<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 1</h4>
<p class="post-p">Just to humblebrag a bit (well, really, to brag; but hey, it's my website), I solved part 1 of day's challenge in the shower. My reasoing went something like the following:</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
    <li>We're looking to select a point <img src="day7/xalign.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> that minimizes the function <img src="day7/p1mineq.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300">, as presented in problem setup.</li>
    <li>Taking the derivative of this sum is somewhat complicated, but there's actually a better way to reason about it.</li>
    <li>Looked at another way, we're looking to find a point <img src="day7/xalign.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> such that moving that point will only cause the total crab-distance traveled to increase; a local minimum.</li>
    <li>Picture our point where our crabs our converging at a point <img src="day7/x.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> on the number line, with <img src="day7/n.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> crabs less than x and <img src="day7/totalcrabsminusn.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> crabs great than <img src="x.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> </li>
    <li>As we slide our alignment point along the number line in a continuous fashion, if it moves a small distance <img src="day7/deltax.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> in, say the positive direction:
        <li class="pl-8">We add <img src="day7/ndeltax.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> units of additional crab travel, as we move further from the crabs at positions less than our alignment point, but</li>
        <li class="pl-8">We subtract <img src="day7/totalcrabsub.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> as we move closer to the crabs greater than our alignment point</li>
    </li>
    <li>And similarly, if <img src="day7/deltax.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> is negative, we get closer to <img src="day7/n.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> crabs and futher from <img src="day7/totalcrabsminusn.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> crabs.</li>
    <li>So, if <img src="day7/ngreater.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300">, increasing <img src="day7/xalign.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> will cause the total crab distance to descrease. And if <img src="day7/nless.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300">, decreasing <img src="day7/xalign.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> with cause thte total crab distance to increase.</li>
    <li>But recall, what we want is to find a point where neither of those things is true; where <img src="day7/xalign.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> is at a mimumum, so any movement of it causes the total crab distance to incerase. This is only true where neither of the above inequalities is statisfied, i.e. when <img src="day7/nequal.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300">.</li>
    <li>Moving some terms around, we find that the total crab distance travelled is at a mimimum when <img src="day7/div2.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300">, in other words, when the number of crabs greater than and less than the alignment point are equal. This is true when <img src="day7/xalign.gif" alt="" class="inline-block px-1 py-0.5 bg-gray-300"> is the median of the crab points.</li>

<p class="post-p">Sadly, my brain failed me when trying to come up with a similarly clever solution for part 2, so I ended up implementing the crab-fuel-expenditure function as described in the problem statement and iteratively increasing and decreasing the alignment point value until a minimum was found. I had the code start at the median value of the list, somewhat arbitrarily, but the code still finishes in under a quarter of a second and yields the correct answer.</p>
<p class="post-p">I skipped a couple of obvious optimizations. 
    <ul class="pb-6 post-ul">
        <li>Incrementing the position that we're currently testing the crab-distance of by only 1 unit each time probably isn't optimal (for my inputs, I had to evaluate 140 positions before finding a minimum). Perhaps some variation on Newton's method could have been used to estimate a better delta for <code class="code">testVal</code>?</li>

<p class="post-p">Whenever the first part of an AoC challenge says <code class="code">For now...</code> you know you're in for an expansion of that area of the challenge in part 2. Today's part one specifcally says to <code class="code">For now, focus on the easy digits</code>, meaning the hard digits are coming right down the pipe.</p>
<p class="post-p">Part 1 is indeed pretty easy - it breaks down to parsing the input, throwing away half of it, then counting the members of a list that have a length of 2, 3, 4, or 7 letters. I had a feeling we'd be parsing the actual digit information in part 2, so I fleshed out a bit of a dataclass to hold the input values, assuming I'd expand this in part 2.</p>

<p class="post-p">Ah, here we go, let's parse some digits. We'll need to figure out which actual segments (from <code class="code">'abcdefg'</code>) are represented by which letters in the input rows.</p>
<p class="post-p">I'll start by organizing the "hookups" (sequences of letters describing the segments lit up for a given digit) ina dictionary by the number of letters in each. This will help us tease apart which segment is which by looking at which segments are in how members members of each of thes lists.</p>
<p class="post-p">For example, as part 1 illustrates, there is only 1 hookup with 2 segments ("1") and 1 hookup with 2 segments ("7"). The segment connected to the <code class="code">a</code> illuminator is present in the "7" hookup, but not in the "1" hookup, and that's their only difference, so it's easy to find what's wired to the "a" segment.</p>
<p class="post-p">The remainder of the deductions are slightly more complicated. For example:
    <ul class="post-ul">
        <li>In the 3 digits with 5 segments illuminated (2, 3, 5), there are three segments common to all three (segments, <code class="code">a</code>, <code class="code">d</code>, and <code class="code">g</code>).</li>
        <li>We've already found what's hooked up to segment <code class="code">a</code>, as above. So the remaining two common segments correspond to illuminators <code class="code">d</code> and <code class="code">g</code>, in some order.</li>
        <li>The segment corresponding to <code class="code">d</code> will be present in the single hookup with 4 illuminated sigments (which corresponds to the digit "4"); the segment corresponding to <code class="code">g</code> will not. So we have established which segments should be wired now to <code class="code">d</code> and <code class="code">g</code>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="post-p">Similar logic allows us to work out:
    <ul class="post-ul">
        <li>Segments <code class="code">e</code> and <code class="code">b</code> (both are in a single digit with 5 illuminated segments, with <code class="codce">e</code> present in 2 hookups with 6 illuminated segments and <code class="codce">b</code> present in 3).</li>
        <li>Segments <code class="code">c</code> and <code class="code">f</code> (both are present in two digits with 5 illuminated segments, with <code class="codce">c</code> present in 2 hookups with 6 illuminated segments and <code class="codce">f</code> present in 3).</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="post-p">There may be a more concise way of working this out, but this method worked out for me.</p>
<p class="post-p">Once we know the mappings from poorly-wired-segments to true segments, we can iterate over all our input rows, transform the messed-up wirings to true wirings using this mapping, map the true mappings to digits, then sum them up.</p>

<p class="post-p">I'm not 100% proud of my solution to today's problems, though it definitely works. Mostly, the way I'm generating the possible-next routes from the currently-arrived-at-room for any given path is just a little hacky. I'm getting a list of all paths (pairs of connected caves) that include the current cave, then finding the element in that path that isn't the current cave. I have to loop through the full list of cave connections every time I want to do this, rather than generating a list of possible connections for each cave out the outset. The efficiency hit here is significant, but for the data size in the problem, it turns out to be fine. </p>

<p class="post-p">...oh, now it's 40 steps. Dang.</p>
<p class="post-p">Thankfully, just like with those dang lanternfish, we don't actually have the store the whole list of letters between each round. The key observation is that each pair of letters geneates a unique pair of pairs of letters for the next step. E.g., for the example input, the pair <code class="code">NN</code> combined with the rule  <code class="code">NN -> C</code> means that if there is a one pair NN at the beginning of a step, there will be one <code class="code">NC</code> and one <code class="code">CN</code> after that step. Or at least, one of each contributed by the <code class="code">NN</code>, as there could be more <code class="code">CN</code>'s and <code class="code">NC</code>'s generated by other rules.</p>
<p class="post-p">But, we can store the possible letter combinations in a dictionary which tracks their count, and then apply these rules at each step to get our answer. We do have to be a little clever about counting up letters at the end - if we total up the counts from each pair a given letter is in, we'll get double our answer... except for the first and last characters of our string, which will be counted exactly 1 less time. Thankfully, the first and laster letters never change under any rule, so we can note those right at the beginning of our code and account for them later.</p>
