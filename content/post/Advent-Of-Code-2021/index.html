<p class="post-p">Is it Advent of Code time again? Well, here goes nothing. Let's see wha we can cook up.</p>
<p class="post-p">I'm planning on completing most (all) of this year's challenges in Python, <a href="/post/advent-of-code-2020/">same as last year</a>.</p>
<div class="w-auto pt-2 pl-2 mr-2 -ml-2 align-top bg-gray-200 md:w-98">
    <p class="text-2xl">Table of Contents</p>
    <div class="ml-8 font-semibold">

    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="table-cell w-auto pb-1 border-b-4 border-gray-200 md:w-96 post-h2 relative-anchor" id="day1">Day 1 - Sonar Sweep</h2>
<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 1</h4>
<p class="post-p">I feel like it's Advent of Code tradition for me to read in the input from file (as strings) and try to do comparisons on it like ints, forgetting to cast them to intergers. Which means I was comparing textually, instead of numerically, so my answer was off by <span class="italic">two</span>. Absurd. </p>
<p class="post-p">You really could do <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1">today's challenge</a> entirely in one line, but I think it's slightly more readable broken up as I've done. Here's the complete code:</p>
<p class="code-title">Day1/Part1.py</p>
{{< highlight python3 "hl_lines=2">}}
with open("input.txt", "r") as infile:
    data = [int(t) for t in infile.read().split('\n')]

numDecreases = len([pair for pair in zip(data[:-1], data[1:]) if pair[0] < pair[1]])

print(f"{numDecreases=}")
{{< /highlight >}}
<p class="post-img-caption">The offending line, where I remembered to cast the input to ints.</p>
<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 mt-4 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 2</h4>
<p class="post-p">Part 2 could also probably be inlined, but the list-comprehension-within-list-comprehension is, again, not the most readable thing, I think. Breaking out the three key steps (creating triples of the data, finding their sums, and finding where adjacent sums are decreasing) into 3 lines of code I think makes the solution more parsable.</p>
<p class="code-title">Day1/Part2.py</p>
{{< highlight python3 >}}
with open("input.txt", "r") as infile:
    data = [int(t) for t in infile.read().split('\n')]

triples = zip(data[:-2], data[1:-1], data[2:])
windowSums = [sum(list(t)) for t in triples]

numDecreases = len([t for t in zip(windowSums[:-1], windowSums[1:]) if t[0] < t[1]])

print(f"{numDecreases=}")

{{< /highlight >}}
<h2 class="table-cell w-auto h-20 pb-1 align-bottom border-b-4 border-gray-200 md:w-96 post-h2 relative-anchor" id="day1">Day 2 - Dive!</h2>
<h4 class="pt-4 pb-1 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 1</h4>
<p class="post-">The first part of today's challenge has us dealing with a list of things that happen sequentially (tracking the horizontal and vertical movements of our submarine), but the answer only has to do with summing them in some specific ways. This smells strongly of a 'gotcha' coming in part 2 - if we can the easy, just-sum-it-up route for part 1, we won't be able to reuse any code for part 2 when the order actually matters. But that's alright, I guess, we'll take the easy route on this one.</p>
<p class="post-p">There's a fair amount of repetition in my list comprehensions here, but for a 7-line program I don't terribly feel like factoring it out.</p>
<p class="code-title">Day2/Part1.py</p>
{{< highlight python3 >}}
with open("input.txt", 'r') as infile:
    # data is a list of tuples; each tuple is of form ('instruction', int) where 'instruction' is forward, down, up
    data = [(line.split(' ')[0], int(line.split(' ')[1])) for line in infile.read().split('\n')]

horizontal = sum([step[1] for step in data if step[0] == 'forward'])
depth = sum([step[1] for step in data if step[0] == 'down']) - sum([step[1] for step in data if step[0] == 'up'])
print(f"Solution product is {horizontal * depth =}")
{{< /highlight >}}
<h4 class="pb-1 mt-4 border-b-2 border-gray-200 post-h4 w-72">Part 2</h4>
<p class="post-p">As expected, we're paying the (small) price for not doing the first part iteratively. That's alright, we can implement it now.</p>
<p class="post-p">This does give me a chance to play with a new feature of Python 3.10: structural pattern matching. It's like a switch-case structure on steroids. To make sure I'm running this code in Python 3.10 specifically, I'll use pipenv to lock the version to 3.10.0 by running <code class="code">pipenv install --python 3.10</code> on the command line.</p>
<p class="post-p">Our code is ultimately fairly simple; thankfully, I encountered no "unmatched instruction" errors, which means I parsed the input correctly.</p>

with open("input.txt", 'r') as infile:
    # data is a list of tuples; each tuple is of form ('instruction', int) where 'instruction' is forward, down, up
    data = [(line.split(' ')[0], int(line.split(' ')[1])) for line in infile.read().split('\n')]

horizontal, depth, aim = 0,0,0

for d in data:
    match d:
        case ('down', num):
            aim += num
        case ('up', num):
            aim -= num
        case ('forward', num):
            horizontal += num
            depth += aim * num
        case _:
            raise ValueError(f"Unmatched instruction {d}")

print(f"Solution is {horizontal*depth= }")
