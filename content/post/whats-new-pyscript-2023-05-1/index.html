Missing between 1284 and 1306?? possibly missed push?

<p class="post-p">Between the big push to <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/">PyconUS 2023</a>, the ensuing sprints and the following flurry of enthusiasm, it's been a busy couple of months for <a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript">PyScript</a>.</p>
<p class="bg-red-600">XXXXXXXX</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">PyScript</h2>
<h4 class="post-h4"><pre>&lt;script type="py"&gt; == &lt;py-script&gt;</pre></h4>
<p class="post-p"><code>&lt;script type="py"&gt;</code> is now a synonym for <code>&lt;py-script&gt;</code> , as are <code>&lt;script type="pyscript"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script type="py-script"&gt;</code> (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1396">#1396</a>). But why have four tags, when we've been getting along fine with just one?</p>

<p class="post-p">The truth is, we haven't quite been getting along. HTML Custom Elements (of which <code>&lt;py-script&gt;</code> is one) are treated just like any other displayable element - their contents are parsed as text, and that text is displayed on the screen, until and unless some styling specifies not to. This means that any characters that have special meaning to the HTML parser like <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> will be parsed like HTML tags, and our Python code becomes a mess. Currently, the only way around this is to make use of the special treatmean the browser affords the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, whose contents are left alone and are not displayed. So if you are running into funky issues with <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> in your code, or code visible on your page in a way you don't want, converting your code to use <code>&lt;script type="py"&gt;</code> may do the trick.</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">The <code>@when</code> decorator</h4>
<p class="post-p">For building interactive and web-friendly pages in Python, one wants a Python way to hookup Python event handler functions to respond to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/event">Events</a> that occur on the page. Thus, in addition to the existing <a href="https://docs.pyscript.net/latest/tutorials/py-click.html"><code>py-*</code></a> syntax, there's a way to hookup event handlers directly in one's python code: the <code>@when</code> decorator.</p>
<p class="post-p">The <code>@when</code> decorator takes two arguments, both as strings: the type of the event to listen for, and a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors">css selector</a> to match Elements to tie the event handler to. The decorated function can take 0 or 1 arguments; if the function takes zero arguments, it will simply be called when the matching event is dispatched. If it takes one argument, it will be called and passed the correpsonding Event.</p>
<p class="post-p">The combination of selectors and the ability to utilize the event object can create powerful interfaces with just a little bit of code. Consider the <code>add_number</code> example below, which uses only one decorated function to handle many buttons.</p>
<p class="post-p">The event listeners are added exactly once, when the <code>@when</code> decorator executes. That is, even if other elements are added to the DOM later that match the given selector, they will not have the event listener attached. Currently, there is no API for removing these event listeners. (Both are noted as desired features for the near future.)</p>
<p class="post-p">You can decorate the same function with multiple instances of the <code>@when</code> decorator, to attach the same listener across multiple events or css selectors.</p>

<h4 class="post-h4"><code>py-[event]</code> Attributes now Dynamically Updated</h4>
<p class="post-p">Continuing the theme of an improved events API, <code>py-[event]</code> attributes, which were previously only assigned once at PyScript load time, are now updated dynamically whenever the attribute changes.</p>
<p class="post-p">As a reminder of what that syntax is: any HTML element can be given an attribute of the form <code>py-[event]="some code"</code>, where "event" is the type of some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/event">DOM Event</a>. When the given even is observed on that element, the string of <code>"some code"</code> will be executed in the global namespace.</p>
<p class="post-p">The term "executed" in the preceding paragraph is not incidental: the code is processed in a way that ultimately redounds to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec()</a>. This means you can use multiple expressions separated by commas or newline characters if desired; while not necessarily the cleanest code practice, it does allow for inlining simple things like imports. See the examples below for some ideas.</p>

<h4 class="post-h4">Dynamically Import Pyodide</h4>
<p class="post-p">One of the things that happens early in the PyScript lifecylce is the loading of the actual Python runtime that will be executing code. Currently, this is simply the Pyodide runtime. Pyodide is now imported into the current page via an <code>import()</code> statement instead of by adding a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to the page. This shouldn't impact end-user behavior, but if you were doing something like using the presence of that <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to signal something, you'll have to find a new (better) method. (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1306">#1306</a>)</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">No more 'Python Initialization Complete' Message</h4>
<p class="post-p">In its early stages, PyScript used the message "Python Initialization Complete" from Pyodide to signal when all of the user's scripts were run. In Pyodide 0.22, this message was removed, but PyScript added it into its own process to keep tests executing smoothly for the time being. That message has been removed from PyScript as well - if you relied on looking at the logs for that specific message for some reason, you will need to find a workaround. (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1373">#1373</a>)</p>

<h2 class="post-h2"><pre>&lt;py-repl&gt;</pre></h2>
<h4 class="post-h4"><code>src</code> attribute for <code>&lt;py-repl&gt;</code></h4>
<p class="post-p">The <code>&lt;py-repl&gt;</code> tag now accepts a <code>src</code> attribute, whose value is a URL represented by a string. When changed or set, the text content from that URL is loaded as the code content of the REPL.  (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1292">#1292</a>). See the added documentation (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1353">#1353</a>)</p>
<p class="post-p">The motivation for this feature (at least for the author of the PR) was being able to use a singular on-page REPL to present many differnt code samples. We've seen a number of folks interested in making their own Python code tutor site with PyScript, to whom this feature may also be useful.</p>
<h4 class="post-h4"><code>&lt;py-repl&gt;</code> attributes: <code>output</code>, <code>output-mode</code>, <code>stderr</code></h4>
<p class="post-p">Users can now add the <code>output</code>, <code>output-mode</code>, <code>stderr</code> to their PyRepl, all of which are strings. (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1106">#1106</a>)</p>
<p class="post-p">The <code>output</code> attribute specifies the ID of an element in the DOM where writes to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdout"><code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code></a> should also be printed, in addition to being written to the <code>&lt;py-terminal&gt;</code>(s). The <code>stderr</code> attribute behaves similarly, but only writes to <code>sys.stderr</code> will be written there (again, in addition to going to the <code>&lt;py-terminal&gt;</code>).</p>
<p class="post-p">Setting <code>output-mode == 'append'</code> as the attribute of a <code>&lt;py-repl&gt;</code> means the output location for the REPL is not cleared before writing. This leads to decidedly un-notebook-like behavior, but it may be desirable for some demos or applications.</p>
<p class="post-">The motivation for this feature was to restore notebook-like behavior of a series of REPL cells on a page. It was enabled by the addition of <a href="#repl-plugins">two new  plugin hooks for REPLs</a>, which you can read about elsewhere in this post.</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">No More ID on py-repl run button</h4>
<p class="post-p">Previously, every REPL run-button had the same id of <code>#runButton</code>, which is a violation of the specified usage of the id attribute. No longer share this one id, and instead all share the class <code>py-repl-run-button</code>. If you need a programatic way to cause of <code>&lt;py-repl&gt;</code> to execute, using a CSS selector or XPath to grab objects with this class (possibly inside a known parent) is the way to go. (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1296">#1296</a>)</p>

<h2 class="post-h2"><pre>&lt;py-terminal&gt;</pre></h2>
<h4 class="post-h4">XTermjs Option</h4>
<p class="post-p">By default, a <code>&lt;py-terminal&gt;</code> is a very lightweight piece of content - just a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag with some css to style it. But many applications benefit from richer console output, and PyScript aims to be useful to those users as well.</p>
<p class="post-p">To that end, Users can now add the <code>xterm = True</code> option to their <code>&lt;py-config&gt;</code> to turn the <code>&lt;py-terminal&gt;</code> into an <a href="http://xtermjs.org/">xterm.js terminal</a>, a fully in-browser terminal implemented in JavaScript. When loaded, the xterm is an output-only page element, but users can implement their own input functionality and extensions by targetting the <code>&lt;py-terminal&gt;</code>'s <code>xterm</code> attribute, which is a reference to the <a href="http://xtermjs.org/docs/api/terminal/classes/terminal/">Terminal object</a> itself (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1317">#1317</a>)</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">Auto-Docked <code>&lt;py-terminal&gt;</code></h4>
<p class="post-p">This release also changes the default placement of the <code>&lt;py-terminal&gt;</code>; rather than being stuck at the end of the DOM if the user doesn't specify a location, the terminal will appear "docked" at the bottom of the browser window. A new <code>docked</code> configuration option in <code>&lt;py-config&gt;</code> (default to 'docked') can be set to False to revert to the previous behavior. (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1284">#1284</a>)</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">Infrastructure</h2>
<p class="bg-red-600">XXXXXXXX</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">Synclink Integration</h4>
<p class="post-p">The first step to bringing PyScript to web workers! (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1258">#1258</a>)</p>
<p class="post-p">Followed by Web Worker support! (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1333">#1333</a>) - very provisional, doesn't have DOM access at this stage.</p>
<p class="post-p">And now pyscript will let your know if your CORS headers are wrong for using workers (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1374">#1374</a>)</p>


<h2 class="post-h2">Deprecation and Removals</h2>
<h4 class="post-h4"><code>pys-on*</code> and <code>py-on*</code> attributes are removed</h4>
<p class="post-p">Existing from the very earliest days of py-script, the long-since-deprecated <code>pys-onClick</code>, <code>py-onClick</code>, <code>py-onKeyDown</code> and <code>pys-onKeyDown</code> HTML attributes have finally been removed from PyScript all together. They were superceded by the <code>py-[event]</code> syntax for hooking up event handlers. (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1361">#1361</a>)</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">Py-Widget has Been Removed</h4>
<p class="post-p">The little known <code>&lt;py-register-widget&gt;</code> tag has been removed; this allowed for registering a named Python class as a custom HTML element. This ability is currently captured by the Plugins api (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1452">#1452</a>)</p>
<h4 class="post-h4"><code>py-mount</code> is deprecated</h4>
<p class="post-p">This little-documented (and little-used) attribute had been available for "automatically" created proxies in Python for associated HTML elements. It's fallen out of step with the current recommended APIs, and since it wasn't much documented or recommended anyway, there were no qualms about deprecating it. It will be removed in a future release.</p>

<h2 class="post-h2" id="pyodide">Pyodide 0.23.2</h2>
<p class="post-p">PyScript now runs on Pyodide 0.23.2! As usual for a downstream project, PyScript basks in the glorious rays of Pyodide upstream, and the many improvements it has received.(<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1347">#1347</a>)</p>
<p class="post-p">While the Pyodide team wrote up an <a href="https://blog.pyodide.org/posts/0.23-release/">excellent post</a> for the release of Pyodide 0.23, I do want to take a moment to highlight some of the larger and more exciting changes:</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">Python 3.11.2</h4>
<p class="post-p">Pyodide 0.23 is pinned to Python version 3.11.2, an upgrade from the 3.10.6 that had previously been bundled. With it come <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/">myriad improvements</a>, including:
    <ul class="post-ul">
        <li>Improved error messages in Exceptions and Tracebacks (<a href='https://peps.python.org/pep-0657/'>PEP 657</a>)</li>
        <li>Exception Groups (<a href='https://peps.python.org/pep-0654/'>PEP 654</a>)</li>
        <li>Adding <code>tomllib</code> to the standard library (<a href='https://peps.python.org/pep-0680/'>PEP 680</a>)</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#faster-cpython">Faster CPython project</a> has been making some strides in speeding up Python generally!</li>
        <li>Many improvements to typing and the type system</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">New Packages</h4>
<p class="post-p">Many new packages have been pre-built by the Pyodide team to work with Pyodide, with their C/Rust/Fortran extensions pre-compiled, including: <code>fastparquet</code>, <code>cramjam</code>, <code>pynacl</code>, <code>pyxel</code>, <code>mypy</code>, <code>multidict</code>, <code>yarl</code>, <code>idna</code>, and <code>cbor-diag</code> .</p>
<p class="post-p">A particularly fun one, in my personal opinion, is the <a href="https://github.com/kitao/pyxel">pyxel</a> game engine pacakge. This retro-framework allows users to write games in pure Python, in the style of early-90s compturs (16-colors and 4 sounds at a time being the chief limitations). The Pyxel and Pyodide teams have both been working to make this engine work out of the box in the browser, and It's built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/emscripten-ports/SDL2">SDL2 Support in Emscripten</a>. <a href="/post/whats-new-pyscript-2023-03-1#pyxel">From personal experience,</a> the ability to run serverless web games right in the user's browser window, written in pure Python, is electric.</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">Efforts on Download Size</h4>
<p class="post-p">The Pyodide team is aware (as in the PyScript team) of the onus that download-size has on the viability of Python in the Browser, and has been <a href="https://blog.pyodide.org/posts/0.23-release/#load-time-and-size-optimizations">making efforts</a> to reduce their download size wherever possible. These efforts are, of course, offset by the continually growing nature of the Python standard library, so the overall download size hasn't changed much. But looked at another way, it's gained more functionality while staying about the same size, which isn't nothing.</p>
<p class="post-p">One experimental effort includes an option to use <a href="https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3701">a version of the Pyodide runtime</a> that pre-compiles the Pyodide packages and the standard library to <code>.pyc</code> files. You can point your <code>runtimes</code> variable in <code>&lt;py-config&gt;</code> to <code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.23.0/pyc/pyodide.js</code> to give it a try! Note that, because the deployment doesn't include the standardlib source code, tracebacks and error messages will not look great, but for some applications this may be acceptable.</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">Removed Deprecated Object Nmaes</h4>
<p class="post-p">Many key functions of the Pyodide Python API, like <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/python-api/ffi.html#pyodide.ffi.create_proxy">create_proxy()</a>, <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/python-api/ffi.html#pyodide.ffi.to_js">to_js()</a>, and <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/python-api/code.html#pyodide.code.eval_code">eval_code()</a>, used to be accessbile directly from the pyodide root package, but were moved to individual submodules in version 0.21 and showed a deprecation warning if imported from root. Now, those functions and many, many others truly can only be accessed from their appropriate submodules (<code>pyodide.ffi.create_proxy()</code>, <code>pyodide.ffi.to_js()</code>, and <code>pyodide.code.eval_code()</code>, for example). (<a href="https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3677">#3677</a>)</p>

<h2 class="post-h2" id="plugins">Plugins</h2>
<h4 class="post-h4">Add <code>&lt;py-repl&gt;</code> plugin hooks</h4>
<p class="post-p">Add <code>beforePyReplExec()</code>, <code>afterPyReplExec()</code> plugin hooks for doing this with repls (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/1106">#1106</a>)</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">All Plugin Methods are <code>await</code>ed</h4>
