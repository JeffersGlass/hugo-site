<p class="post-p">Another month, another big release for PyScript! With a shorter release cycle, there's been lesstime for upstream projects (Pyodide, Emscripten) to move ahead, but there's still been loads of work done on PyScript in the past month.</p>

<h4 class="post-h4">Streamlined py-config</h4>
<p class="post-p">The py-config system has been overhauled to simply its use internally - including simplifying how the default configuration options are merged with user-supplied options (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/806">#806</a>), dealing with multiple <code>&lt;py-config&gt;</code>s on a page <a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/826">#826</a>), and finally killing <code>&lt;py-env&gt;</code> altogether (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/775">#775</a>).</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">Undefined elements are no longer hidden</h4>
<p class="post-p">Previous, any unknown HTML elements were hidden by <code>pyscript.css</code> in an attempt to suppress onscreen visibility of things like <code>&lt;py-config&gt;</code>. This had the unintended consequence of hiding elements with typos - for example, a user-typed <code>&lt;py-scrip&gt;</code> element would be "unkown" and also hidden. Now, PyScript explicitly only hides the page-elements that need hiding. <a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/837">#837</a></p>
<h4 class="post-h4">Caching, Fetching, and Retrying on Tests</h4>
<p class="post-p">The pytest-driver test system used to re-download the Pyodide runtime and other resources for each testing, significantly slowing it down. The test system now has the ability to cache resources between tests, and retry tests on network failures. (<a href="https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/pull/829">829</a>)</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">CodeMirror 6</h4>
<p class="post-p">Just like <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/accelerating-jupyterlab-68942bb8d602#2404">JupyterLab 6</a>, PyScript now uses the latest version of CodeMirror to power the in-browser <code>&lt;py-repl&gt;</code> component.</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">TOML Parser</h4>
<p class="post-p">&lt;py-config&gt; now accepts TOML, but there was an issue with the parser in that it would hang on misshapen TOML instead of exitting.</p>
<h2 class="pb-1 border-b-2 border-gray-300 post-h2 anchor" id="Team">The PyScript Team</h2>
<h4 class="post-h4">More Anaconda Contributors</h4>
<p class="post-p">Anaconda Senior Tech Writer Katherine Kinnaman jumped into the Github project, creating issues for much-needed documentation.</p>
<h4 class="post-h4">New Maintainers</h4>
<p class="post-p"><a href="https://github.com/pauleveritt">Paul Everitt</a> and I are now maintainers on the PyScript project!</p>
