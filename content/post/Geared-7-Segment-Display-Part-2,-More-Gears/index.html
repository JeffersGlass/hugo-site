<p class="post-paragraph">While time at home is scarce this week, I've stolen a couple moments late night to continue working on the design of the geared <a href="https://jeff.glass/2018/04/17/7-segment-display-via-gears-part-1/">7-segment display</a>, including finishing the modelling of the 7 drive gears.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Each drive gear is based on a 30-tooth, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute_gear">involute gear</a> of module 4. Each segment of 3 adjacent teeth represents a single transition of a segment (or lack there of) - if there are teeth in a segment, the associated arm gear will rotate, changing a segment from active to inactive for a given transition or vice versa.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">As a side note, each gear has a even number of teeth remaining, and each segment makes an even number of transitions as the display makes a full cycle of ten digits. If a segment made an odd number of transitions, it would start the next "cycle" in a different state than on the previous cycle, causing the numbers to "look" different on each time a given number came up, which is clearly wrong. This served as a useful sanity check as I was working through each gear in turn.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Here is the mechanism in its current Fusion360 form (support plates, arms and mounts, and a drive mechanism yet to come):</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">The A, D, and G arm gears lie on the vertical axis of the mechanism. The A and G arm gears, as noted in my previous post, are currently intended to be co-axial, the shaft of the A segment being a small hollow tube which completely surrounds the shaft of the G segment. Of all the details in this mechanism, this one seems the most fiddly at the moment, since any tolerance issues are going to compound on each other.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">The B, C, E, and F arm gears lie at ±50<b>° </b>from the vertical axis, which is just about as close to the vertical axis as they can be and still have their arms clear the axes of the A/D/G segments.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">In contrast to what I said a the end of my last post, I'm thinking I'll print each of the gears individually and then mount them on the center axle with spacer washers. The whole-gear-assembly-as-barrel has one fatal flaw: printability. That's a lot of overhanging teeth to worry about. That said, the print-individual-gears approach means needing to worry about registering adjacent gears to each other, but that seems like a solvable problem.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Looking down the road, here's a quick Vectorworks sketch of how close adjacent digit displays could be. It seems I could squeeze them to about 175mm (~7 inch) centers.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">Currently, the plan is to build one digit and evaluate... but the only thing better than N mechanisms is N+1 mechanisms...</p>
