<p class="post-p">One of the challenges in translating Python to the web is this very simple piece of example code, pulled <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements">straight from the Python docs:</a></p>
{{< highlight "python3" "linenostart=1" >}}
x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))

if x < 0:
    x = 0
    print('Negative changed to zero')
elif x == 0:
    print('Zero')
...
{{< /highlight >}}

<p class="post-p">The problem is with the <code class="code">input</code> statement, which essentially tells the Python interpreter's thread to block (i.e. lock up, freeze, do nothing) until it receives data from an external source (the terminal) that it can respond it.</p>
<p class="post-p">Unfortunately, this doesn't translate well to the web. The idea of 'block the interpreter thread until something else wakes it up' is that, in the Browser, there is only one thread*! Hence, there's no 'something else' to come along and wake the interpreter's thread back up. Nor is there any equivalent of "ctrl+c", no way to "kill" that thread from within the browser - something would have to be listening for that singal and reach out and kill the thread with the interpreter... and again, there's only one thread.</p>
