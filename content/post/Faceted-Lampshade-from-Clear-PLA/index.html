<p class="post-paragraph">I've had a clear, "low poly" angular sculpture in clear PLA sitting on my self for awhile now. Earlier this week, I turned it into a lamp shade.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">I built the original model in Blender along the lines of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IwJDfT-H6o">this video from Maker's Muse</a>. The gist of the process is:</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>Start with a basic solid, like a sphere or a cube.</li>
<li>Decimate the solid (reduce the number of triangles that make up the shape) to a very very low level, perhaps down to 20 or 30 polygons.</li>
<li>Stretch and place the vertices of this blocky solid until satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<p class="post-paragraph">In this case, I had ideas about turning this shape into a lighting table topper, with an Arduino and LEDs underneath the open base. But other projects popped up, and this open-base blocky pyramid has sat dormant for several months. This week, I finally found a use.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">In my living room, I have a tall two-socket light fixture standing in the corner. One socket stands at the top of the lamp, with a broad frosted dish shade, and there's a small flexible arm coming off the side of the lamp which lost its shade long ago. My partner and I both enjoy using this flexible arm as a re-positionable reading lamp, but that lack of a shade means it's been pretty glare-y.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">By trimming the top off of the clear pyramid, I converted the Agrocrag into a lampshade.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">The shade is trapped in place by the bulb itself. Of course, an LED bulb is a must, since the heat of an incandescent (or even CFL) light bulb will melt or deform the shade.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">Just a little project-reuse for the home!</p>
