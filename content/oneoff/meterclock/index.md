Years ago, I built an "analog" clock out of three analog meter movements, an Arduino Pro Mini, and a DS3231 Real Time Clock module. The legends were created in the [Meter program by Tonne Software](http://www.tonnesoftware.com/meter2.html). THe case is a 1/8" piece of basswood with plexi mounted in front with #4 bolts, nuts, and standoffs
