For a production of Moby Dick, the director wanted Ahab's harpoon to glow with a heated, unearthly light just before the second intermission. I glued some warm-white LED tape just below the plexiglass tines of the harpoon, and dimmed them with an [RC4 Wireless Dimmer](https://rc4wireless.com/). The power came from three 18650 lithium ion batteries.
