As I was getting started building amateur radios, I ran into an issue whenever I would go to operate by the lakefront in Chicago. The direct line-of-site to downtown meant my frontend was getting absolutely blasted through by the large AM transmitter sites downtown. I built a small (admittedly unshielded) high pass filter to cut off everything below about 3 MHz, and this helped some.
