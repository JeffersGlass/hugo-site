A very popular lighting controller in the theatrical nonprofit world is the [ETC Ion](https://www.etcconnect.com/Products/Consoles/Eos-Family/Ion/Features.aspx), which was my primary controller two lighting jobs ago now. I found that a 16-key set of [Programming XKeys](https://xkeys.com/xk16.html) fits just right alongside the control console. The keys act like a USB keyboard to run pre-programmed macros on the console to replicate common or longwinded sequences of keystrokes.
