During a summer sabatical, I experimented with making my own bacon. I obtained roughly 4 lbs of pork belly from a local butcher, wet-brined it for about a week in the fridge, then smoked half and oven-roasted the other half. The slow smoked was miles better, but I had more issues with heat-control, so some of the additional flavor was simply from caramalization on the outside.
