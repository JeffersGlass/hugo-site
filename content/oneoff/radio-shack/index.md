As part of my pursuits as a ham radio operator, I set about to install a humble ham radio station in preparation for the Winter of 2021-22. Prior to this, I had been limited to operating entirely portably, outdoors and away from the noise of the city. As the days grew colder, I added a couple of ELFA shelves underneath my 3D printer, to place my FT-891, antenna tuner, and a few other accessories. It works alright - there is indeed a lot of RF noise in the city. But it means I don't have to wander out in to the cold just to play a little radio.
