When one is building a crystal filter for SSB reception in amateur radio, it's critical to know some of the properties of the crystals one is using. Especially its exact resonant frequency, motional inductance and capacitance. THe [G3UUR Crystal Checker setup](https://kk9jef.wordpress.com/2016/04/25/g3uur-crystal-oscillator/) makes these relatively easy to determine, by switching an additional series capacitance in and out.
