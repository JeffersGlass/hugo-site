The airflow situation is often very stuffy, especially in the summer months. The adjacent workroom has abundant AC, enough to keep a full room full of incandescent fixtures at bay. I punched through the wall (with permission) and mounted the fan from an old server rack over the top. I added grills to both sides to prevent knicked fingers. I designed and 3d-printed a cover with locking knurled handles to cover the hole when I'm not present or the temperature is fine.
