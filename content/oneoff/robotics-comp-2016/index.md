In Spring 2016, I had the priveldge to MC a local middle school robotics competition that was part of the [VEX Robotics Competition](https://www.vexrobotics.com/v5/competition/vrc-current-game). The 2016 challenge, [Nothing but Net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8daR6qBw3M), involved creating robots that behaved autonomously and then under remote control, to acquire and fling balls into nets. A true treat of a day, and some serious mechanical skill on the part of the middle-schoolers.
