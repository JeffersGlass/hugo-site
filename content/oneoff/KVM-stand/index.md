My work often involves switching between several computers - a laptop, a beefier desktop, an 'IT Sanctioned' clean machine with access to the work network, and a temporary line to whatever computer's on the workbench. To improve the ergonomics of using the KVM switch, I designed and 3D-printed a small stand to hold the switch controls, then labelled it using an old embossing Dymo label maker.
