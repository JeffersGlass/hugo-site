As part of the series of informal electronics classes I taught online during the COVID-19 pandemic, I developed a need for a small benchtop voltmeter for quickly displaying relevant voltages. The unit is a 2xCR2032 coin cell battery holding with integral switch, combined with a simple 3x7-Digit Display voltmeter, both from Amazon. While not terribly precise, it serves the desired purpose of indicate rough voltage on camera.
