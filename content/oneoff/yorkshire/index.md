A traditional holiday dessert at my inlaws' is Yorkshire Pudding. A simple egg and flour batter is poured into piping-hot muffin tins filled with melted butted and drippings from the holiday roast, which then rise and pop up into fluffy, delicious, buttery muffin things. Very tasty, would recommend.
