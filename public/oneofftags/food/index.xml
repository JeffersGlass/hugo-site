      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a summer sabatical, I experimented with making my own bacon. I obtained roughly 4 lbs of pork belly from a local butcher, wet-brined it for about a week in the fridge, then smoked half and oven-roasted the other half. The slow smoked was miles better, but I had more issues with heat-control, so some of the additional flavor was simply from caramalization on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A traditional holiday dessert at my inlaws&#39; is Yorkshire Pudding. A simple egg and flour batter is poured into piping-hot muffin tins filled with melted butted and drippings from the holiday roast, which then rise and pop up into fluffy, delicious, buttery muffin things. Very tasty, would recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
