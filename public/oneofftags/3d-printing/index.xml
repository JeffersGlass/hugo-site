      <title>KVM Stand</title>

      <description>My work often involves switching between several computers - a laptop, a beefier desktop, an &amp;lsquo;IT Sanctioned&amp;rsquo; clean machine with access to the work network, and a temporary line to whatever computer&amp;rsquo;s on the workbench. To improve the ergonomics of using the KVM switch, I designed and 3D-printed a small stand to hold the switch controls, then labelled it using an old embossing Dymo label maker.</description>

      <description>One of our retrofit projects at work required using four small DAC boards to converet 0-5V PWM into true 0-10V analog voltage. I designed and printed some small snap-on DIN rail mounts for these to cleanly mount them in their enclosure.</description>

      <title>Airflow Passthrough</title>

      <description>The airflow situation is often very stuffy, especially in the summer months. The adjacent workroom has abundant AC, enough to keep a full room full of incandescent fixtures at bay. I punched through the wall (with permission) and mounted the fan from an old server rack over the top. I added grills to both sides to prevent knicked fingers. I designed and 3d-printed a cover with locking knurled handles to cover the hole when I&amp;rsquo;m not present or the temperature is fine.</description>

      <title>Votive Fence Hooks</title>

      <description>I had very little to do with this one, but just think it&amp;rsquo;s neat - a friend was hosting a small backyard wedding, and while he had designed a 3D-printed hook to hold votive candles on a fence, his printer was down. I spun up around 30 hooks that week, and the wedding turned out beautiful.</description>
