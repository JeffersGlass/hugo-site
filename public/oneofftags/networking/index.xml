      <title>Lighting Control Rack Overhaul</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tasked myself with overhauling one of the lighting control closets at work. This used to house a 1995 Unison Heritage lighting controller for archetectural control, as well as an MA2 remote playback unit to control some LED fixtures and moving lights. It was all housed in an abysmal rolling rack with no connectors on it; why the rack needed to roll is beyond me. I packaged it up into a freestanding rack and replaced the Unison Heritage processor with an ETC Nomad controller for proper entertainment lighting control; installed a new network switch; and fully documented the rack&amp;rsquo;s purpose, wiring, and configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
