<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p class="post-p">Nothing terribly fancy going on with the day 2 challenge - essentially, reading in a text file and doing operations on strings. After developing the ability to split the input lines and validate them in part one, part 2 throws a curveball by changing up how the lines should be validated. I refactored my "isValidLine" code to take a validation function as one of its arguments, since the parsing/splitting of the line is the same for both parts 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="post-p">(<em>The names of the validation functions come from the problem description - they validate the passwords for a sled company and a toboggan company, respectively</em>.)</p>

<p class="post-p"></p></div></figure>
<h2>Day 3</h2>
<p class="post-p">A slightly more involved bit of data and text processing today, as we help our would-be tobogganist make it down a snowy slope covered in trees. As a way of pushing my Python knowledge, I tried to complete both parts of today's challenge using list comprehensions and iterative functions like map, reduce, enumerate, etc. My impulse is to write things out more explicitly by iterating through the elements of input in a for loop, but practicing the list comprehensions and their related utility functions feels good.</p>
<p class="post-p">Is the inline code better than the more verbose versions? I'm not entirely sure - it's certainly less readable than the expanded-into-a-loop versions. It's also somewhat harder to debug, because there aren't logical places to, say, print intermediate results. So something like my getSlopeTrees() function, as written, is just silly-long and hard to read - the getSlopeTreesVerbose() function, which I wrote as part of troubleshooting a specific issue is definitely more readable.</p>
<p class="post-p">The punchline of my issue was: at least in Python 3.9, floats can't be used as list indices, even if they're integers. That is, even if a float for which is_integer() returns true, you must explicitly cast that float to an integer to use it index a list. In code form:</p>

<p class="post-p"><script src="https://gist.github.com/JeffersGlass/e2ceed37a5b459304216389328854e87.js"></script></p>
<p class="post-p"></p></div></figure>
<p class="post-p">So, another thing learned. Thanks Advent of Code!</p>
<p class="post-p">Here's the full code from Day 3:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<p class="post-p"><script src="https://gist.github.com/JeffersGlass/9dbd5c3977a9ddaa59308001d55dd48a.js"></script></p>
<p class="post-p"></p></div></figure>
<h2>Day 4</h2>
<p class="post-p">We can slowly feel the difficulty starting to ramp up here in day four. We're still walking on paved roads, as it were, but they're not as well maintained as they used to be in day one.</p>
<p class="post-p">Today's problem concerns more text parsing - the first part just says to validate, essentially, that 7 unique strings are present between sets of blank lines in the input file. The code for this is pretty straightforward - I tried for a little while to do it all in one list comprehension, but ended up splitting it into two lines, which I think is clearer. To be sure, I don't think that doing it in one comprehension would be <em>better</em>, just that I thought it would be fun practice.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<p class="post-p"><script src="https://gist.github.com/JeffersGlass/cf670f595c99db49b8564cc600ce26c6.js"></script></p>
<p class="post-p"></p></div></figure>
<p class="post-p">Of course, with the problem statement framing these 7 strings as labels for values in a passport (eyc:blu, hgt:171cm, etc), it seemed like a straight guess that we'd actually have to parse those values by field and do something with them in part two. And of course, we were right. For each of the 7 fields, validation criteria are listed, including ensuring certain fields are numerical and within certain bounds, prepended or postended by certain characters, and so on. </p>
<p class="post-p">This part turned out ok - it takes the text file, splits it into individual passport strings, then splits each of those into a list of strings of the form "key:value". The part that feels most "un-Pythonic" to me is the part (commented below) that turns that list of lists of strings into a list of dictionaries. I figure there's got to be a way to do that with a comprehension, but I couldn't quite make it work, so I did it as a couple For loops. It works fun, just feels a little clunky.</p>
<p class="post-p">I also implemented my own prettyPrintPassword function (and its alias 'ppp') - it doesn't do any sorting of the fields, and it doesn't show you <em>why</em> a passport is invalid if it fails, but it did what I needed it to do for troubleshooting purposes.</p>

<p class="post-p"><script src="https://gist.github.com/JeffersGlass/de08f5f205eddaccbe56980f9b3d4d29.js"></script></p>
<p class="post-p"></p></div></figure>
<h2>Day 5</h2>
<p class="post-p">Wow, a quickie today! The title of the day's challenge ('Binary Boarding') gives you a pretty strong clue what it's going to be about. The challenge is essentially to parse text representing binary numbers in your language of choice and find the minimum, maximum, and missing values in between. </p>
<p class="post-p">This is my shortest solution so far, at only 5 lines of code (for both parts!):</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<p class="post-p"><script src="https://gist.github.com/JeffersGlass/a233c4ef04fc5eb9422bebf8b0106770.js"></script></p>
<p class="post-p"></p></div></figure>
<p class="post-p">This is where Python's use of convenience generators (like range), built in math functions on general iterators (like min and max), and lots of string functionality (like replace) really shines - the code is easy to write and clean.</p>
<p class="post-p">Looking back at <a "="" 11="" 2020="" 25="" advent-of-code-2020="" data-id="3332" data-type="post" href="&lt;script src=" https:="" jeff.glass="">my goals for Code.js"&gt; Advent 2020</a>, I'd say I'm doing pretty well - I'm already feeling more fluent/comfortable with list/dictionary comprehensions, the git workflow is becoming more natural, and I've completed each project on the day it's issued. Not too much challenge in terms of the algorithms and data structures so far, but then it is only day 5....</p>
<p class="post-p"><em>This post will be updated with code from a handful of future days, until it gets too long/unwieldy.</em></p>
<h2>Day 6</h2>
<p class="post-p">As it turns out, talking out loud while generating algorithms while writing code is... hard. </p>
<p class="post-p">I coded up the solution to Day 6 <a href="&lt;script src=" https:="" watch?v='s7UDMUALBxU"' www.youtube.com="">live on stream on Sunday.js"&gt; night</a>, which was both fun and challenging. Part one of the challenge wasn't too terribly hard - it basically asks whether each letter of the alphabet is contained between any pair of blank links ("\n\n") in the input file. That's a solution that only takes a few lines to write.</p>
<p class="post-p">I ended up writing three solutions to part 2. I ended up ordering them in the code in order of their complexity/lines of code, but that's not the order I wrote them in. I first wrote a really over-complicated solution (3), then condensed it down to a single list comprehension (1), then expanded that back out just a little to make it more readable. Like I said on stream, if I were writing this code to go into some kind of actual codebase, I think solution (2) is the one I'd use - it's concise enough to be comprehensible, but long enough to not be overwhelmingly dense.</p>

<p class="post-p"><script src="https://gist.github.com/JeffersGlass/2801abec57bce67bad64d553974984b6.js"></script></p>
<p class="post-p"></p></div></figure>
<h2>Day 7</h2>
<p class="post-p">Oof, this day too far, far longer than it should have, all because I misunderstood Python's strip() function. strip, for those who are wondering, removes any of the set of characters given as its arguments from the beginning or end of a string. So, "Hello World".strip('Hld') =&gt; "ello Wor". Unfortunately, I thought that the strip function removed the exact <em>string</em> given it it as an argument, leading to it stripping additional characters off of the end of some inputs and causing my parsing to be wrong. Oof.</p>
<p class="post-p">In any case, the two halves of day 7 involve creating a tree of data in two different ways (one in which parents reference children, and one in which children reference parents). Then we sum up the total number of parents or children, unweighted or weighted, respectively.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<p class="post-p"><script src="https://gist.github.com/JeffersGlass/52440fef8db4118166b0cda14c6e7a65.js"></script></p>
<p class="post-p"></p></div></figure>
<h2>Day 8</h2>
<p class="post-p">Day 8 is giving me flashbacks to the <a 2"="" 2019="" adventofcode.com="" day="" href="&lt;script src=" https:="">intcode challenges</a> of 2019! .js"&gt;But it's a much softer start this time - we only have three pseudo-assembly instructions to parse, and simpler questions to answer. Once we've built a simple function for processing a given list of these instructions, we've solved part one. Part 2 requires iterating over our input data and manipulating it slightly, and testing to see whether the new version of the input fulfills the required condition, so our code will need to work over general lists of instructions.</p>
<p class="post-p">The only thing that hung me up today was forgetting to take into account how Python's lists handle objects. Specifically, this is the behavior that I was (rightly, but unwantedly) seeing:</p>
<p class="post-p"><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>listA = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,6]]</code></pre></p>
<p class="post-p">listB = [a for a in listA]</p>
<p class="post-p">listB[0] = [4, 8]</p>
<p class="post-p">print(listA)</p>
<p class="post-p">&gt;&gt;&gt;[[4,8],[2,4],[3,6]]</p>
<p class="post-p">Though it doesn't look like listA is ever being modified, the way we've constructed listB, it actually <em>references</em> the same objects as listA. So when we change the object [1,2] to be [4,8], it changes everywhere that object is referenced in both lists. A little thing I once knew, but had skipped my brain for about 8 minutes. Whoops!</p>

<p class="post-p"></p></div></figure>
<h2>Day 9</h2>
<p class="post-p">Well that felt pretty good! The consensus across the interwebs (twitter, reddit) seems to be that today was relatively easy, and I'd agree. The problem involved two different ways of comparing integers in an input list to the previous 25 numbers, and doing some math on them. There are probably slightly more efficient algorithms, especially for part 2 - currently when the running sum starting from a given position, I throw out the entire sum and start again from the next position, which is likely wasteful. But for only 1000 inputs, the code still runs in ~160 milliseconds, so I don't think it's worth the time to make it more efficient.
