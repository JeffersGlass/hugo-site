					<p class="post-p">Over the past 12 months or so, I've dipped my toes into some basic cheesemaking, including cream cheese, farmer's cheese, and ricotta. But for me, there's no better cheese than a sharp white cheddar, and with an eye toward making cheddar and some other hard cheeses, I've built my own cheese press and my own first hard cheese.</p>
<p class="post-p">The process I used to construct the press is very similar to <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Simple-and-Inexpensive-Cheese-Press/">this instructable</a>. I used a 1x6x48" Maple board from Menards as the base, and two pieces of 1x2 Poplar from an earlier project. The threaded rod, nuts, wingnuts, and washers are all 3/8" hardware. I added <a href="https://www.menards.com/main/tools-hardware/household-hardware/casters-furniture-hardware/furniture-slides-glides/shepherd-hardware-reg-7-8-silver-threaded-furniture-glide-4-pack/9449/p-1444442245054-c-13088.htm?tid=4069837351917205904&amp;ipos=12">fourÂ threaded furniture feet</a> to raise the press off the countertop and allow for tilting the press slightly to allow the whey to run off. I used some butcher-block conditioner to help seal the wood before use. (Having access to a theatrical scene shop helps.)</p>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-282 post-img" height="540" src="IMG_5567-e1543977868759-1024x768.jpg" width="720"/>
<p class="post-p">My first pressed cheese is a "farmhouse cheddar", made according to <a href="https://www.littlegreencheese.com/2011/09/farmhouse-cheddar-video-tutorial.html">this recipe from Gavin Weber</a>. Specifically, the ingredients I used were:</p>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>2 Gallons (4 half-gallon containers) of <a href="http://www.kalonasupernatural.com/our-products/organic-milk/organic-whole-milk/">Kalona Whole Milk</a> from our <a href="https://www.freshthyme.com/">Fresh Thyme Market</a>. While unpasteurized milk seems to be recommended for a lot of artisinal cheese making, that's hard to come by in urban Chicago, so this non-homogenized milk is the way I've gone.</li>
<li>1 Sachet of Mesophillic Culture, purchased from <a href="https://www.pursuitsupply.com/">Pursuit Supply Co</a>, a small business here in Chicago that focuses on homebrewing and distilling, cheesemaking, and film development.</li>
<li>1/2 tsp of Liquid Vegetable Rennet, also from Pursuit Supply</li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>This was diluted in 1/4 cup of bottled (unchlorinated) water before adding, since apparently chlorine kills the coagulating action of the rennet</li>
</ul>
<li>1/2 tsp of Calcium Chloride (from, where else, Pursuit), also mixed with 1/4 cup bottled water. I understand this introduces more soluble calcium to the mixture and helps the curds to form.</li>
<li>2 generous tbsp of non-iodized sea salt.</li>
</ul>
<p class="post-p">The process, as outlined by Gavin (of Little Green Workshops) is straightforward. Here is is summarized by me, with <em>comments</em> as to how my own process went:</p>
<ul class="post-ul"></ul>
<li><strong>Sterilize all materials that will come into contact with the milk or cheese.</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>I used a preparation of <a href="https://www.pursuitsupply.com/five-star-star-san-4oz/">Star-San</a> mixed with water in the recommended ratio of 1:640 (1 Oz per 5 gallons). I soaked the large stirring spoon I planned to use, as well as all the measuring cups in this for a few minutes. Meanwhile, I boiled a couple quarts of water in my large stockpot to sterilize the pot itself, then wiped the lid down with the Star-San mixture.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>To a large stockpot set up as a double-boiler, add the 2 gallons (8 liters) of milk.</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>I used one of my large general-purpose pots underneath my stockpot as a double boiler, and it was remarkably stable.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Heat the milk to 33C (92F)</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>This took about 20 minutes with my double boiler setup:<img alt="A large red pot of milk on a gass stove" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-283 post-img" height="540" src="IMG_5576-1024x768.jpg" width="720"/></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Stir in the diluted calcium chloride</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sprinkle the starter culture over the top, then stir for 1-2 minutes to incorporate</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul"><li>Gavin's recipe calls for 1/8 tsp of culture, I simply used one small sachet.</li></ul>
<li><strong>Cover, and allow the milk to ripen for 45 minutes</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>This allows the culture to start to grow a little and the milk to begin to acidify</li>
<li>I turned off the heat at this stage to allow things to maintain their temperature, but when I returned after 45 minutes, the temperature had shot up over 40C! Oops!</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Stir in the diluted rennet while stirring. Stir for no more than a minute as the milk with start to set.</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>I treated myself to a very large metal spoon for this project</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Check for a clean break with a clean finger</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>Basically, stick a finger in through the top layer of curd - if it feels firm-ish, it's good to go. If it's a little soft and yogurt-y, you can cover and wait another 10 minutes or so.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Cut the Curd</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>There are some fancy curd cutters out there that look like a wire mandolin or harp, but I just used a long clean knife, run through up-down, left-right, and twice angled.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Slowly heat the milk and curds to 38C (100F) over about half an hour</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>Even with a double boiler setup, my setup took a little modulation (higher heat, lower heat, higher heat) to not spike in temperature too fast. I took about 25 minutes to raise the temp up to 38C, sitrring continuously
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-284 post-img" height="540" src="IMG_5579-1024x768.jpg" width="720"/></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Let the curds rest for 10 minutes at 38C</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>At this point, I should have taken the pot off the double boiler, but I figured it would help keep the milk warm. It sure did - by the time I returned 20 minutes later, the temp was up to 44C! It remains to be seen whether this will have a negative effect on the cheese.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Drain the pot into a clean cheesecloth-linedÂ </strong><b>colander</b></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>I collected the Whey at this point and made a Whey Ricotta out of it. Yum!</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Tie up the edges of the cheesecloth and hang for an hour to drain some of the whey out</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li><em>Â </em>I had a spare bit of PVC pipe leftover from my <a href="https://jeff.glass/2018/07/09/a-portable-20-30-40m-vertical-antenna/">multiband antenna project</a>, so I set that between the backs of two chairs and set the pot underneath to catch the drippings.
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-285 post-img" height="540" src="IMG_5583-1024x768.jpg" width="720"/></li>
</ul>
<li><b>After an hour's dripping, transfer the curds back into a pot. Break the cheese mass into walnut-sized pieces. Toss 2+ TBSP of non-iodized salt throughout.</b></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>I used non-iodized sea-salt, instead of some of the products which are marketed as "cheese salt." Not sure what the difference is</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Line a sanitizedÂ cheese mold with a sanitized cheese cloth. Transfer the curds to the press. Flip a corner of cheese cloth over the top of the curds, and place the follower on top.</b></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>I originally tried 3D printing a mold, but I got cold feet about subjecting a 3D print to 50+ lbs of pressure overnight, fearing it would crack. I also thought it would be good to seal the PLA with polyurathane or similar before trusting it to be food-safe. So I made a simple press out of a plastic jug from Walmart with the bottom and handle cut off, and holes punched through the sides.</li>
</ul> <li><strong>Press for 10 minutes at ~10 lbs.</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>I set up my press in a low-sides baking sheet to catch the whey as it ran off, and used the threaded-feet to set the press slightly off plumb so the whey all ran off one side.</li>
<li><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-286 post-img" height="540" src="IMG_5588-1024x768.jpg" width="720"/></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Remove the curds from the press and cloth, turn over, and press 10 minutes at ~25 lbs.</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>Quite a lot of whey running off at this point. Fairly cloudy, which I read is not good, but I'm not sure why...
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-287 post-img" height="540" src="IMG_5595-e1543978264792-1024x768.jpg" width="720"/></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Remove the curds from the press and cloth, turn over, and press for 12 hours at ~50 lbs</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>I left the cheese to press overnight, checking it once a couple hours and tightening the springs a bit.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Remove the wheel of cheese from the press and cloth. Trim any bits of cheese that have popped up around the follower.</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>Leave these in the fridge for a couple days and they're basically cheese curds! So tasty!
 <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-288 post-img" height="540" src="IMG_5597-1024x768.jpg" width="720"/></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Place the cheese on the counter under a bit of cheesecloth or similar to air-dry. Turn twice daily until it has a nice rind and is quite dry to the touch.</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>I left my cheese on the counter for a little under 3 days before waxing. Possibly I should have left it longer to develop a drier rind, but we shall see when we break the thing open.
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-289 post-img" height="540" src="IMG_5626-1024x768.jpg" width="720"/></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Wax or vacuum seal the cheese</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>After drying for a couple days, the options are to either cloth-band, wax, or vacuum seal the cheese to prevent any nasty bugs getting into the cheese.</li>
<li>One of Gavin's most popular videos describes Cloth-Banding the cheese, but in his final tasting of that cheese, he describes the process as too fiddly (and he did get some mold in a bit of that cheese early on). So I decided to wax the cheese instead. Pursuit was sadly out of cheese wax (soft parafin-based wax) when I stopped by, so I ordered some Beeswax from the internet to arrive the next day.
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-290 post-img" height="540" src="IMG_5630-e1543978805873-1024x768.jpg" width="720"/></li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Age the cheese for 1 month to... forever?</strong></li>
<ul class="post-ul">
<li>Currently, the cheddar is aging in a small mini-fridge in the basement, though with it being the earlyÂ  months of winter, the fridge is turned off and is just functioning as an airtight box. I added a small dish of water and a small dish of saturated salt to raise the relative humidity to around 80-85%.</li>

<p class="post-p">So... now we wait! I'm thinking, with this being a first cheese, we'll crack it open around valentine's day (~3 months) to see how I did, then possibly re-seal it and age longer if it seems like everything's going well.</p>
<p class="post-p">One next step will be to measure the pressure that my chosen springs will create when the press is tightened down entirely. I discovered that my bathroom scale doesn't fit within the scale, so much like the instruct able suggests, I'm putting together a test jig with a wider base to allow me fit the springs around the scale and make a weight gauge. I'll also need to replace the felt-bottomed feet with something that doesn't absorb whey (I threw the feet out after this batch).</p>
<p class="post-p">Here's hoping it all turns out well!</p>
