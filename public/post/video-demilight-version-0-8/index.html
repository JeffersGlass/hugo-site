					<p class="post-p">It's been quite awhile since the <a href="https://jeff.glass/demilight/">mini-moving light project</a> (now renamed The Demilight) has been written up on the blog. The project was in hiatus for a few months while dove into the technical challenges of a new job, but as the job isn't keeping quite as busy at the moment (here in early summer 2020), it's back on the workbench. I've put together a video showcasing the current state of the project, now in <strong>version 0.8:</strong></p>
<p class="post-p">{{&lt; youtube 4a-9JGK8H4I &gt;}}</p>
<p class="post-p">The video does a pretty decent job of capturing the current state of things. So what's next?</p>
<p class="post-p">Firstly, the goofs I alluded to in the video that I consider to be <em>must-fix</em> items before the files are ready for primetime. Theu mostly have to do with the 3D-printed parts - I adjusted the access holes and programming slots from version 0.5 to 0.8, but I didn't do a great job double-checking everything, and things don't line up very well. That'll need another few test prints and some adjustment to alleviate the all the filing that's currently necessary.</p>
<p class="post-p">I've also been having some issues with mechanical assembly - I've been using some <a href="https://amzn.to/2Vg1pWw">M2 insert nuts</a> to hold the case and case-lid together, and to secure the PCB into the case, but that doesn't seem to be a particularly good system. It's possibly my nuts and bolts are just really high-tolerance, but they're constantly cross-threading and not inserting all the way. I think a more robust solution is in order.</p>
<p class="post-p">The other main error has to do with the footprint for the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/recom-power/R-78E5.0-0.5/945-1648-5-ND/2834904">5V buck-converter</a> module - somehow, my pin placement is off by .2" on the PCB footprint, which makes the part overlap with the attachment points for the servos unless you bend the voltage-regulator's pins over. Not insurmountable, but really annoying. That'll have to get fixed in version 0.9. Once those two most-egregious errors are corrected, though, I think the unit will be decent enough to publish as a beta version.</p>
<p class="post-p"><img alt="" class="post-img" height="236" src="https://media.digikey.com/Photos/Recom%20Power%20Inc/MFG_R-78-e%20series.jpg" width="243"/></p>
<p class="post-image-caption">It's a pretty simple part... how did I goof this up?</p>
<p class="post-p">There are several more substantial improvements in the pipeline as well. In no particular order:</p>
<p class="post-p">As I mention in the video, I'm working on a <strong>miniaturized programmer interface</strong> based on some little <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/mill-max-manufacturing-corp/0985-0-15-20-71-14-11-0/ED1122-ND/3635123">0.05"-pitch pogo pins</a>. The results, so far, have been mixed - I have been able to confirm that the interface is providing gnd/5V to the ATmega328, at least enough that its 16 MHz ceramic resonator is oscillating, but I can't seem to program the chips in-place. Further experiments will be necessary.</p>
<p class="post-p"><a href="https://jeff.glass/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pogo-Pins.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-1095 post-img" height="194" src="Pogo-Pins-1024x718.jpg" width="276"/></a></p>
<p class="post-p">Some iterations of the Demilight have incorporated a <strong>heatsink </strong>to help manage the heat-output from the LED emitter chips. To be honest, I'm not sure how necessary it is - I would love to set up some tests with the unit running at its full 1 Amp current and see just how hot things get. Perhaps the first test would be in free-air, then inside the case in multiple orientations. I know from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYT-xtOL4rU&amp;t=299s">some tests I did on a livestream last summer</a> that with enough heatsinking the LED stars can handle up to about 5 Amps, but they dump a huge amount of heat at the point.</p>
<p class="post-p"><a href="https://jeff.glass/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/heatsink.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1118 post-img" height="256" src="heatsink.png" width="341"/></a></p>
<p class="post-image-caption">If the heatsink comes back, should it still be in candy-apple red?</p>
<p class="post-p"><strong>RGB </strong>or <strong>RGBW</strong> dimming capacity would be really neat - as spiffy as the pure-white versions are, there's something about color-changing light that feels like it would take this project to the next level. I would need to free up some more PCB space, and possibly move from a single-channel driver to a 3 or 4 channel driver, but finding those in the ~1A current capacity range seems a little tricky.</p>
<p class="post-p">There are also a couple of purely aesthetic things which could get bumped up to something better. I've ordered some <a href="https://amzn.to/31g67Yj">1/4" white wire sleeving</a> to take the place of the gaff tape covering the wires that run from head to base. And I need to invest a little time dialing in my 3D printer - after <a href="https://jeff.glass/2019/03/09/3d-printing-in-the-home-workshop/">3.5 years of printing,</a> it's starting to show its age a little bit, and a little extra tightening and lubrication wouldn't be a bad idea.</p>
<p class="post-p"><hr/></p>
<p class="post-p">So many of my projects during quarantine have focused on building my digital communication mediums - building out this video feels very much like a continuation of that skill-building. The <a href="https://jeff.glass/electronics-bash/">weekly Arduino/Electronics classes</a> I've been teaching for 15 weeks now have been a serious crash course in live digital video. That learning process deserves a write-up of it's own, but if you compare the following two frames from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRVTTIWVcXA&amp;t">Episode 0 (testing)</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQYhC7xHG_s">Episode 14 (Wireless Signals)</a>, I think the improvements are pretty clear:</p>
<p class="post-p"><a href="https://jeff.glass/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EarlySnap.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1116 post-img" height="253" src="EarlySnap-300x168.png" width="450"/></a></p>
<p class="post-img-caption">Epsiode one was.... pretty rough. The audio is really crunchy too - turns out I had two microphones on (lav and webcam) and they did unkind things together.</p>
<p class="post-p"><a href="https://jeff.glass/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/latesnip.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1117 post-img" height="253" src="latesnip-300x168.png" width="450"/></a></p>
<p class="post-img-caption">We've got things pretty well dialed in by now.</p>
<p class="post-p">It's been a joy to build some more digital video skills putting this video together, like putting together a basic script, recording a voiceover, learning the editting, effects, and color-grading processes... it's been both fascinating and time-consuming. The video definitely has some rough edges, but I'm thinking of it as good-enough, and I'm excited to take what I've learned from this early creation and apply it to future videos. Much like the tiny-light itself, it's good to just make a thing, anything, a small thing, and iterate from there.</p>
