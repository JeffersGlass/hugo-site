      <description>With the 50W QRP amplifier project coming along nicely, I felt it was time to start thinking about a reproducible case for the project. And for custom, reproducible cases, 3D printing is my current tool of choice.
I ended up designing the case on a YouTube Livestream on Saturday night, to which a few great colleagues stopped by to ask questions and offer advice. The full video is below.</description>

      <description>The 5W-to-50W QRP HF Amplifier project is rolling along nicelyÂ - I received the first PCB draft in the male this week and am 90% of the way through assembling it, with only heatsink-placement left to sort out.
I&#39;ve made a couple of additions to the schematic since the original layout, including a relay-activated indicator (R27 and its LED) and an RF-output sensing LED (from C14 to its associated LED to ground) along the the lines of VK3YE&#39;s recent project.</description>
