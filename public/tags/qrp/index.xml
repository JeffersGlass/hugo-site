      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;With the 50W QRP amplifier project coming along nicely, I felt it was time to start thinking about a reproducible case for the project. And for custom, reproducible cases, 3D printing is my current tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;I ended up designing the case on a YouTube Livestream on Saturday night, to which a few great colleagues stopped by to ask questions and offer advice. The full video is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;{{&amp;lt; youtube kVQQyohYvAA &amp;gt;}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;The case is in two parts - a box with standoffs for the PCB and holes for connectors, and a lid with labels. The standoffs and the attachment holes for the lid are meant to connect with M3 threaded-inserts and be held down with M3 machine screws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;This was my first time using Fusion 360&#39;s Eagle Sync function - since Eagle PCB design software was acquired by AutoDesk in 2016, it makes sense that they&#39;ve been working to integrate PCB design workflows into their other products. The sync was fair straightforward - open Fusion360, select Eagle Sync, select your board file in Eagle, and after a minute or two of importing, up pops your PCB in Fusion360. Neat! I&#39;m still struggling with how to handle board cutouts in eagle, and I&#39;m not sure how well they&#39;ll be supported in Fusion, but that&#39;s a project for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;Here&#39;s the final design as it turned out in Fusion360:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;amppic1&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-3191 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;762&#34; src=&#34;amppic1.png&#34; width=&#34;1069&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;ampic4&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-3192 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;823&#34; src=&#34;ampic4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;554&#34;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;amppic&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-3190 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;756&#34; src=&#34;amppic.png&#34; width=&#34;1022&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;The PowerPole model was provided by Chris Wych, a theatrical propmaster who&#39;s done some really interesting work with Fusion360, including using it to model some 2d-printable geodesic designs which then folded up into geometric shapes. Very cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;First print of this design coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>50W QRP Amplifier – PCB Layout Video</title>
      <link>https://jeff.glass/backup-post/50w-qrp-amplifier-pcb-layout-video/</link>

      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;This past weekend, I started on the process of laying out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/2018/07/14/50w-qrp-amplifier-first-demonstration/&#34;&gt;50W QRP Amplifier project&lt;/a&gt; as a PCB. Small PCBs can be remarkably inexpensive these days - $10-$15 for 5 pieces of say 4&#34;x4&#34;, shipped in 2-3 weeks. I&#39;m treating this amplifier project as a chance to experiment with different, similar FETs to learn about critical power MOSFET properties, and also as an opportunity to brush up my layout skills that I haven&#39;t used in awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;As the first step of PCB design, I captured the schematic of the amplifier as built in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview&#34;&gt;AutoDesk Eagle&lt;/a&gt;. I did this on a livestream on YouTube, the first time I&#39;ve tried such a thing. It was great fun! &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com&#34;&gt;Kenneth W6KWF&lt;/a&gt; stopped by to lend advice - he deals with prototype PCBs as part of his day job, though he has team members to do most of the actual layouts when needed. We&#39;ve had a great deal of fun over the years, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS1XJ1OVwfs&#34;&gt;building a cloud chamber&lt;/a&gt; for seeing charged ions in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;Here&#39;s the full (2h45m!) livestream in all its glory! There&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lymB7f_2LU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=2h40m59s&#34;&gt;recap and full-circuit overview at 2h41m&lt;/a&gt; for those who want to see the final circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>50W QRP Amplifier - First Demonstration</title>

      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is cross-posted to my ham-radio specific blog, &lt;a href=&#34;http://kk9jef.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;kk9jef.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;As I alluded to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/2018/07/09/a-portable-20-30-40m-vertical-antenna/&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve been working on a simple &#34;QRP Amplifier&#34; to kick my power up from 5W to something a little more punchy. Specifically, an amp I can still use when portable. There&#39;s something wonderful about achieving a contact with only 5W, but there&#39;s also the frustration of getting into the field and having band conditions just wreck your day. It&#39;d be nice to have the power to crank up the juice for special occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;While I have awhile to go before this project is wrapped up with a bow and ready for field use, here&#39;s a brief video about my first successful test. 5W in, 50-60W out when run off two 13.8V sources in series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;{{&amp;lt; youtube &#34;mIcHUApgFt8&#34; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;More technical details to come, but for now, I consider this a really successful validation of the idea! Like I say, a few more critical steps to come, including an input 50-ohm pad, a low pass filter, and a case, but this is enough of a proof of concept to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;Hear you on the air!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Portable 20/30/40m Vertical Antenna</title>

      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is cross-posted to my ham-radio specific blog, &lt;a href=&#34;http://kk9jef.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;kk9jef.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;Following the Forth of July, I took a few days off of work to recuperate from a grueling work project that we pushed over the finish line on the third. And what better way to relax in the wake of a heatwave than getting out in the beautiful, low-70&#39;s weather and working on a new portable HF antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pole.jpg&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-3170 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;467&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/pole.jpg&#34; width=&#34;467&#34;/&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; From eBay listing[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;The heart of the antenna is an inexpensive &#39;7.2m&#39; telescoping fishing pole, which can be had for &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2KJeAMq&#34;&gt;less than $30 with Prime shipping&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ebay.com/itm/Telescopic-Stream-Pole-Spinning-Freshwater-Fishing-Rod-Fiberglass-2-7m-7-2m/142089295648?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;amp;var=441178774721&amp;amp;_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&#34;&gt;less than $10 if you don&#39;t mind waiting&lt;/a&gt;. The pole weighs about 10 ounces, comes with a small fabric sheath, and collapses down to about 24&#34;. I&#39;ve been wanting to try out something like this since I stumbled across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlM8eQ6v2As&#34;&gt;VK3YE and his squid-pole setups&lt;/a&gt; awhile back - Peter&#39;s also featured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCXdCLpnju0&#34;&gt;these particular poles&lt;/a&gt; in another video. Be aware, a pole called &#34;7.2m&#34; may not actually be 7.2 meters from end to end: check the listings carefully:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;rod&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-3157 post-img&#34; height=&#34;158&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/rod.png&#34; width=&#34;595&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; Note the difference between the &#34;stretch&#34; column and the &#34;specification&#34; column.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;The length of the pole is enough for a quarter-wave vertical for 20m with some room to spare on either end. To allow for multi-band operation, I added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://qrpguys.com/qrpguys-tri-band-portable-vertical-antenna&#34;&gt;QRPGuys Tri-Band Vertical&lt;/a&gt; accessory to the bottom of the antenna. The piece is essentially just two loading-coils (in this case, iron-powder toroids) with slide-switches to short them out. The 20m configuration is a true quarter-wave vertical; one of the toroids is switched in series for 30m, and both are placed in series for 40m. Ultimately, not a complicated setup. While it would be easy enough to homebrew, the ergonomics of the switches, the hardware to attach the antenna wire and radials, and the clever PCB setup are enough to make it worth the $15 to just buy the darn thing. It even has little notches on the edges of the PCB for straps/ties/rubberbands to attach it to the vertical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;triband&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-3163 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;600&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/triband.jpg&#34; width=&#34;338&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; From QRPGuys.com[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;Tuning the antenna is straightforward: you cut a piece of wire (a bit long) for a 20m quarter-wave, and lay out four 10&#39; radials. Then, you bit-by-bit trim down the vertical element to resonate at the desired point in the 20m band. Then you switch in the 30m coil and compress/expand its turns &lt;em&gt;without changing the antenna length&lt;/em&gt; to resonate on 30m. Finally, switch in both coils and adjust the second coil to resonate on 40m &lt;em&gt;without changing either the antenna length or the first coil&lt;/em&gt;. Voila, a tri-band, base-loaded antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;Unfortunately, my antenna analyzer is old school, and doesn&#39;t have a frequency readout. It&#39;s an old &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mfjenterprises.com/Product.php?productid=MFJ-207&#34;&gt;MFJ-207&lt;/a&gt; that I scooped up at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kk9jef.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/six-meter-club-of-chicago-smcc-hamfest-2016/&#34;&gt;SMCC Hamfest in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and while it does have a port to attach a portable frequency counter, I couldn&#39;t find my cheapie one on the day. But I do have a nice &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/heath_digital_frequency_counte.html&#34;&gt;Heathkit IM-2420 Frequency Counter&lt;/a&gt; with an internal OXCO that I scored an amazing deal on at a hamfest last year (it had an intermittent power switch). So, I attached the MFJ to the antenna, tuned its analog VFO for lowest SWR, walked inside without touching the dail and hooked it up to the frequency counter to see where the center frequency was. Repeat for say the upper and lower 2:1 SWR ranges. Trim the antenna a little, and repeat measurements. Once 20m is tuned, repeat with adjusting the coils for 30m and 40m. A fairly cumbersome process, but for three frequency ranges on one antenna, it was a half-hour project at most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;IMG_4804&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-3161 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;645&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/img_4804.jpg&#34; width=&#34;481&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;In the end, the antenna is less than 2:1 SWR across all of the 20m band, all of the 30m band, and all but the top 50 Khz of the 40m band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve glossed over the mechanical details of the antenna to this point - the base of the telescoping pole fits snugly-yet-easily into the a piece of 1&#34; schedule-40 PVC pipe. I bought a 5&#39; section from the local big-box store and cut off a ~10&#34; section to hold the antenna. I strapped two ground-stakes that &lt;a href=&#34;https://kk9jef.wordpress.com/2018/05/24/dayton-hamvention-2018/&#34;&gt;I got at Hamvention this year&lt;/a&gt; to the bottom with a couple zip-ties and a couple rubber-bands. Finally,  I threaded a long 3/8&#34; eye-bolt though a matching hole about 2&#34; from the bottom of the pipe and secured it with a nut on either side - this acts as both a stop for the pole so it doesn&#39;t fall out the bottom, and provides an easy hand- or foot-hold for pressing the stakes into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;img_4840.jpg&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3164 post-img&#34; height=&#34;477&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/img_4840-e1531104071612.jpg?w=453&#34; width=&#34;453&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; The finished antenna mount. It may be getting a coat of high-vis paint in the near future.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;The setup for the radials was something I stumbled across by chance while buying the PVC pipe. Our local big-box hardware store was having a sale on these &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2KZXINI&#34;&gt;RECOIL Brand cable winders&lt;/a&gt; that are meant for headphones or charging cables or similar. I&#39;ve found that they can &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; hold four 10&#39;, 24-guage speaker wire radials. This is solving the problem of wires-getting-tangled-in-a-bag that I&#39;ve had with all my antennas to date. Thank goodness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;img_4842.jpg&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-3165 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;470&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/img_4842-e1531104647814.jpg&#34; width=&#34;478&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; A few loose ends are worth it for the assurance that the wires won&#39;t get tangled in transit.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;It takes about 6 minutes to setup or tear down the antenna:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;post-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stakes are driven into the ground with a firm foot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The telescoping pole is unwrapped and placed in the base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The antenna wire is unwound from the QRPGuys winder and tied to the tip of the telescoping pole with a small bit of cotton-wrapped nylon line &lt;em&gt;(what we&#39;d call &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2KZhfOk&#34;&gt;tie line&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt; The top section the pole is very flimsy, so I add a second tie to the next-largest section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pole is pushed up to full height, taking the antenna wire with it, which leaves the QRPGuys rig hanging about 2&#39; off the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The QRPGuys rig is tied to the pole with another bit of tieline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The radials are unstrung from their winder, pinched to the ground terminal on the QRPGuys rig, and spread out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run coax to a nearby table/seat/rock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up radio, battery, key, antenna, and logbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;IMG_4810&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-3162 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;874&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/img_4810.jpg&#34; width=&#34;651&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; The antenna fully set up and freestanding.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;Of course, my very first time away from home with the antenna... I forgot the radial wires. D&#39;oh! I was way out in the suburbs, too. I wasn&#39;t about to drive an hour home and an hour back for 4 bits of wire, so I first tried out the antenna with no radials (just the coax as a counterpoise). This worked alright - I picked up K2D in CT in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://13colonies.net/&#34;&gt;13 Colonies event&lt;/a&gt; on the second call (this at 5W QRP with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/8874&#34;&gt;ATS-4&lt;/a&gt;), but was having trouble with other contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;Since I planned to swing by the local Fry&#39;s Electronics on this adventure, I decided to pause operating for a while and make that run. Mostly I was picking up parts for an amplifier project (more on that to come), but while I was there, I looked for solutions to my radial problem. I found a 10&#39; section of RJ11 phone cord with 4 wires for $1.69 - perfect! Back out in a new park, I stripped the wires out of their jacket, spread them on the ground, and tied them to the antenna&#39;s ground terminal. Instant radials!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;IMG_4814&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-3158 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;619&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/img_4814.jpg&#34; width=&#34;461&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; And such colorful radials too![/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;With the antenna back to spec, things really picked up - surely, being on 20m at sundown didn&#39;t hurt either. I scooped K2A (NY), K2B (VA), K2H (MA), K2L (SC), and K2M (PA), as well as the 13-cols bonus station WM3PEN in Philly. Many of these I got on the first or second call, though K2L was a real struggle. There was a very patient operator on the other end though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;13cols&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-3167 post-img&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/13cols.png&#34; width=&#34;1169&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; The 13 Colonies special operating event runs each year for a week around the 4th of July in the US.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;I picked up a couple of other interesting stations along the way: PJ2/KB7Q out of Curacao (&lt;em&gt;though the license gives away that he&#39;s either an ex-pat or visiting)&lt;/em&gt;, and CQ918FWC from Madeira Island (!) off the coast of Portugal. There were a number of these World Cup special stations on the bands this week as we close in on the finals. At 3800+ miles away, this was my best DX of the day, and a great proof of concept for the new antenna.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is cross-posted to my ham-radio specific blog, &lt;a href=&#34;http://kk9jef.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;kk9jef.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Following the Forth of July, I took a few days off of work to recuperate from a grueling work project that we pushed over the finish line on the third. And what better way to relax in the wake of a heatwave than getting out in the beautiful, low-70&#39;s weather and working on a new portable HF antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pole.jpg&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-3170 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;467&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/pole.jpg&#34; width=&#34;467&#34;/&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; From eBay listing[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The heart of the antenna is an inexpensive &#39;7.2m&#39; telescoping fishing pole, which can be had for &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2KJeAMq&#34;&gt;less than $30 with Prime shipping&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ebay.com/itm/Telescopic-Stream-Pole-Spinning-Freshwater-Fishing-Rod-Fiberglass-2-7m-7-2m/142089295648?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;amp;var=441178774721&amp;amp;_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&#34;&gt;less than $10 if you don&#39;t mind waiting&lt;/a&gt;. The pole weighs about 10 ounces, comes with a small fabric sheath, and collapses down to about 24&#34;. I&#39;ve been wanting to try out something like this since I stumbled across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlM8eQ6v2As&#34;&gt;VK3YE and his squid-pole setups&lt;/a&gt; awhile back - Peter&#39;s also featured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCXdCLpnju0&#34;&gt;these particular poles&lt;/a&gt; in another video. Be aware, a pole called &#34;7.2m&#34; may not actually be 7.2 meters from end to end: check the listings carefully:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;rod&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-3157 post-img&#34; height=&#34;158&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/rod.png&#34; width=&#34;595&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; Note the difference between the &#34;stretch&#34; column and the &#34;specification&#34; column.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The length of the pole is enough for a quarter-wave vertical for 20m with some room to spare on either end. To allow for multi-band operation, I added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://qrpguys.com/qrpguys-tri-band-portable-vertical-antenna&#34;&gt;QRPGuys Tri-Band Vertical&lt;/a&gt; accessory to the bottom of the antenna. The piece is essentially just two loading-coils (in this case, iron-powder toroids) with slide-switches to short them out. The 20m configuration is a true quarter-wave vertical; one of the toroids is switched in series for 30m, and both are placed in series for 40m. Ultimately, not a complicated setup. While it would be easy enough to homebrew, the ergonomics of the switches, the hardware to attach the antenna wire and radials, and the clever PCB setup are enough to make it worth the $15 to just buy the darn thing. It even has little notches on the edges of the PCB for straps/ties/rubberbands to attach it to the vertical.&lt;/p&gt;

I found a 10&#39; section of RJ11 phone cord with 4 wires for $1.69 - perfect! Back out in a new park, I stripped the wires out of their jacket, spread them on the ground, and tied them to the antenna&#39;s ground terminal. Instant radials!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;IMG_4814&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-3158 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;619&#34; src=&#34;https://kk9jef.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/img_4814.jpg&#34; width=&#34;461&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt; And such colorful radials too![/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;With the antenna back to spec, things really picked up - surely, being on 20m at sundown didn&#39;t hurt either. I scooped K2A (NY), K2B (VA), K2H (MA), K2L (SC), and K2M (PA), as well as the 13-cols bonus station WM3PEN in Philly. Many of these I got on the first or second call, though K2L was a real struggle. There was a very patient operator on the other end though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I picked up a couple of other interesting stations along the way: PJ2/KB7Q out of Curacao (&lt;em&gt;though the license gives away that he&#39;s either an ex-pat or visiting)&lt;/em&gt;, and CQ918FWC from Madeira Island (!) off the coast of Portugal. There were a number of these World Cup special stations on the bands this week as we close in on the finals. At 3800+ miles away, this was my best DX of the day, and a great proof of concept for the new antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
