      <description>With the 50W QRP amplifier project coming along nicely, I felt it was time to start thinking about a reproducible case for the project. And for custom, reproducible cases, 3D printing is my current tool of choice.
I ended up designing the case on a YouTube Livestream on Saturday night, to which a few great colleagues stopped by to ask questions and offer advice. The full video is below.</description>

      <description>This past weekend, I started on the process of laying out the 50W QRP Amplifier project as a PCB. Small PCBs can be remarkably inexpensive these days - $10-$15 for 5 pieces of say 4&#34;x4&#34;, shipped in 2-3 weeks. I&#39;m treating this amplifier project as a chance to experiment with different, similar FETs to learn about critical power MOSFET properties, and also as an opportunity to brush up my layout skills that I haven&#39;t used in awhile.</description>

As I alluded to last week, I&#39;ve been working on a simple &#34;QRP Amplifier&#34; to kick my power up from 5W to something a little more punchy. Specifically, an amp I can still use when portable. There&#39;s something wonderful about achieving a contact with only 5W, but there&#39;s also the frustration of getting into the field and having band conditions just wreck your day.</description>

Following the Forth of July, I took a few days off of work to recuperate from a grueling work project that we pushed over the finish line on the third. And what better way to relax in the wake of a heatwave than getting out in the beautiful, low-70&#39;s weather and working on a new portable HF antenna.
