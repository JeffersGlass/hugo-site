      <description>One of the earliest homebrew ham radio transceivers I built was a direct-conversion receiver for the 40m band. I packaged it in the aluminum box of the &amp;ldquo;Lose Your Virginity&amp;rdquo; kit I had been given as a gag gift by some friends, and therefore christened it &amp;ldquo;The Virgin Receiver.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>One of our retrofit projects at work required using four small DAC boards to converet 0-5V PWM into true 0-10V analog voltage. I designed and printed some small snap-on DIN rail mounts for these to cleanly mount them in their enclosure.</description>

      <description>In April 2016, I undertook to properly organize my E12 series resistors in a way that I could actually find the darn resistor I was looking for when I needed it. The result was many small, color-coded and labelled boxes that each contain a single value of resistor for easy access.</description>
