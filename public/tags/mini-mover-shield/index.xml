      <title>Video: Demilight Version 0.8</title>

      <description>It&#39;s been quite awhile since the mini-moving light project (now renamed The Demilight) has been written up on the blog. The project was in hiatus for a few months while dove into the technical challenges of a new job, but as the job isn&#39;t keeping quite as busy at the moment (here in early summer 2020), it&#39;s back on the workbench. I&#39;ve put together a video showcasing the current state of the project, now in version 0.</description>

      <title>Arduino DMX &#39;Light Board&#39;, Mini Moving Light Hanging Hardware</title>

      <description>Over the past week, I got to the point with the mini moving light that I needed some way to consistently pump DMX into my prototypes to test their functionality. Thankfully, the first set of PCBs I built for this project function as both DMX receivers and transmitters, so whipping together a basic DMX controller only took about 20 minutes.
So here it is: my tiny DMX controlled &#34;light board&#34;:</description>

      <description>With the shell 3D-printed and the PCB assembled, I went ahead and put together my first &#34;completed&#34; mini-moving light, live on camera:

It went fairly well - everything mostly worked and nothing caught fire!
There are a few mechanical and electrical takeaways for the next version, including:
Mechanical:Ennlarge the hole for LED wires in the lower caseMake a brief instruction manual for myself of what needs to be assembled/installed/solder in what orderHole for program/enable switch accessFix tolerances on the tilt-servo/yoke interfaceLengthen the body to accommodate a heatsink for the LED starFigure out mounting/hanging hardwareElectrical:Increase the spacing between Pan and Tilt Servo padsOrder higher-current 5V regulator (1.</description>

      <title>DMX Mini Moving Light Shield V0.3</title>
      <link>https://jeff.glass/backup-post/dmx-mini-moving-light-shield-v0.3/</link>

      <description>As I hinted to in my original post about the Arduino Pro Mini DMX Shield, and then talked some about in my PCB Assembly Livestream, the latest version of my DMX shield is geared toward driving in miniature moving light. This means that, in addition to being able to receive DMX, the Arduino driving the device will need to be able to drive a couple of servos and dim a relatively high power LED.</description>

      <description>Last night, as I started to assemble V0.3 of my DMX Mini-Mover Shield, I thought it might be fun to switch on my webcam and stream the assembly live to the World Wide Web. What follows is about 80 minutes of unstructured benchwork, chatting about DMX, sACN, and circuitry, and a first test of the new LED dimming circuit. Will it light up, or will it go boom? Watch the video to find out:</description>
