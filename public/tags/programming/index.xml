      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;Over the past couple weeks, as a way to stretch my programming legs and play around with a new system, I&#39;ve been writing a little demo in the 8-bit retro video game environment called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php&#34;&gt;PICO-8&lt;/a&gt;. Since I think I&#39;m drifting away from this project now, I figured I might as well post my progress here: a &#34;game&#34; demo called &lt;strong&gt;Orbit&lt;/strong&gt; that instantiates a number of objects moving in an elliptical orbit around a central planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;One of the neat things about PICO-8 is how easy it is to embed a playable demo! Here is the full program running in your browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&#34;m-auto&#34; height=&#34;600&#34; src=&#34;https://jeff.glass/pico8/orbit/orbit2.html&#34; width=&#34;600&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;The program starts by instantiating 5 orbiting objects around a central planet. You can switch which object you&#39;re focusing on using ← and →. The two primary buttons (defaults to C and X on a desktop, or onscreen keys on mobile) allow access to the menu at the top-right. The menu has functionality for speeding up or slowing down time, adding and removing objects, and changing whether orbits are displayed and what info shows up on the HUD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;This is about the third time I&#39;ve recreated essentially this same structure in different languages/environments. The first time was in Lua in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://love2d.org/&#34;&gt;LOVE2D &lt;/a&gt;framework, the second was in Python in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pygame.org/news&#34;&gt;PyGame&lt;/a&gt;, and now it&#39;s in pseudo-Lua in PICO-8. I&#39;m not sure why this construct - just getting thing to orbit each other, really - appeals to me so much. But clearly there&#39;s something there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;Each of the orbiting objects is &#34;on rails&#34; in a sense - rather than apply some kind of gravitational force each timestep, each object is locked into a perfect elliptical orbit defined by four orbital parameters (semi-major axis, eccentricity, argument of periapsis, and mean anomaly at epoch. Given a time T and those four parameters, the engine can calculate exactly where each object should be. Then we just let T advance at some fraction/multiple of real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-large&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-1201 post-img&#34; src=&#34;orbit_000.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;The next step in turning this into some kind of actual game would be to allow the orbiting objects (&#34;ships&#34;) to apply a small amount of thrust that changes their orbit. This involved calculating the current Cartesian parameters (position and velocity) and turning those into new orbital parameters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-large&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-1202 post-img&#34; src=&#34;orbit_001.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;The hangup with this in PICO-8 is that all numbers are 32-bit fixed precision (0xFFFF.FFFF), with a range of -32768 to 32767.9999. While this is enough range to capture all the fundamental parameters of the orbit themselves (the largest of which is the semi-major axis, which can be up to about 200), it&#39;s not enough dynamic range to do some of the calculations for converting cartesian parameters to orbital ones. Even finding the magnitude of a 2D vector with components ~150 or greater involves an intermediate step with numbers larger than 32767, which is a problem when that&#39;s the largest number we can represent in our number system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image size-large&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-1203 post-img&#34; src=&#34;orbit_002.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;I briefly toyed with creating a system to present 64-bit numbers as a duo of 32-bit fixed-point ones, but it&#39;s not quite where my interests lie at the moment. So the project pauses here for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-paragraph&#34;&gt;In any case, in encourage you to try out PICO-8 and play around. It&#39;s very approachable and a ton of fun, takes me right back to my days writing QBasic on my middle-school math teacher&#39;s computer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Arduino Pro Mini DMX Shield</title>
      <link>https://jeff.glass/post/arduino-pro-mini-dmx-shield/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;In my dayjob as the lighting supervisor of a midsize regional theater, we get to play with all kinds of fancy (and expensive) lighting equipment - moving lights, high-power color changing LED units, ultra-compact wireless dimmers, and so on. But it&#39;s also fun to build inexpensive, maker-size versions of of this equipment, and it can be done on a shoestring budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;About a year ago, I built a couple versions of tiny moving lights - one directly from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1912706&#34;&gt;a design from Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;, the other of my own making. The end result was super cute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wp-block-embed__wrapper&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BTafFpI3Vgc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The thing with this tiny light compared to real moving lights was... I cheated a bit. The light itself only contains the servos and LED chip itself, while the controller, LED driver and ballast were all external. The full setup took up almost 3 times the volume of the individual light:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-391 post-img&#34; src=&#34;IMG_7264spun-1024x768.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Not only did I cheat on size, I cheated on control a bit too. The unit has a number of &#39;test&#39; modes that run simple movement and color patterns, but there was no means of controlling the light externally. While there are It was basically a fancy keychain toy. And there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/CQRobot-network-Management-Extended-Functions/dp/B01DUHZAT0&#34;&gt;DMX Shields&lt;/a&gt; in the Arduino Uno form factor, they themselves would have outsized the lights by another 200%. It was all getting too bulky to be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;But after many months away from this project, I&#39;ve been devoting some time to scaling down both the dimming and DMX control sides of the circuitry. The result is a shield for an &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-pro-mini&#34;&gt;Arduino Pro Mini&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;DMX&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;As described in my previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/2019/02/23/lighting-control-protocols-and-standards/&#34;&gt;write-up of contemporary lighting control protocols&lt;/a&gt;, the core standard for modern stage and event lighting is DMX, or properly, ANSI E1.11 DMX 512-A Digital Multiplex. In short, DMX is a serial protocol and physical spec that caries up to 512 one-byte values over each individual cable, usually with 5-pin DMX connectors. One set of 512 values is termed a &#34;universe,&#34; and to carry additional values, additional cables carrying different universes of information may be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-387 post-img&#34; src=&#34;dmx512-1024x252.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;More formally, DMX is a 250 kbps serial protocol transmitted over a 2-wire bus following &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485&#34;&gt;RS-485&lt;/a&gt; standards. The ESTA standard standards also dictate standardized connectors (XLR5 for temporary installations, RJ45 for permanent infrastructure), network topologies, impedances, terminations, and so on. &lt;a href=&#34;https://tsp.esta.org/tsp/documents/published_docs.php&#34;&gt;The standard is pretty readable&lt;/a&gt;, if you enjoy that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;DMX was developed in the late 80&#39;s/early 90&#39;s as a replacement for systems in which lighting equipment was controlled via analog control voltages, meaning each parameter (each individual dimmer, say) required one wire. A rack of 96 dimmers would have 100+ pin wiring harness attached to it, each with an analog voltage specifying level. With the introduction and adoption of DMX, all that was replaced with a single 3-conductor cable. All modern stage lighting controllers speak DMX, although most rely on transporting universes of DMX over Ethernet and using &#39;DMX Nodes&#39; to turn that digital data back into &#39;hard&#39; DMX close to the fixtures being controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Circuit Components&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;There is really only on piece of hardware required to add to an Arduino-compatible design to allow it to send/receive DMX: an RS485 transceiver chip. There are many of these on the market, the common ones being the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/interface/transceivers/MAX485.html&#34;&gt;MAX485 &lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ti.com/product/SN75176B&#34;&gt;SN75176&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter is-resized&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-373 post-img&#34; height=&#34;263&#34; src=&#34;max485-pins.png&#34; width=&#34;336&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;These take a single-ended input and turn it into a balanced output or, conversely, receive a differential RS485-compatible input and convert it to a single ended signal to a microcontroller. There are two control pins which determine whether the chip is a receiver or a driver. The control circuitry is essentially the same at both the transmitting and receiving end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-374 post-img&#34; src=&#34;MAX485-1024x463.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;A more sophisticated/robust approach would also incorporate an optoisolator to prevent the processor from being damaged by faults on the signal side. There are some good guides on the interwebs on &lt;a href=&#34;https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/100487/dmx-on-arduino-with-rs485&#34;&gt;setting up optoisolation with DMX for an Arduino&lt;/a&gt; (Mathertel.de has a good &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mathertel.de/Arduino/DMXShield.aspx&#34;&gt;write up of their isolated DMX shield&lt;/a&gt;), but for the sake of quick progress I&#39;m making this a future goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Circuit Layout and PCB Manufacture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The circuit is ultimately very simple - a couple headers, some resistors, a MAX485 IC, and some pads to connect the DMX connectors to. And a switch - the DMX library I&#39;m using abuses the Arduino&#39;s built-in Serial library for some of its functionality, which means it has to use pins D0 and D1. Which means you can&#39;t reprogram the Arduino with DMX coming in. The DPDT switch just removes the connection between the DMX connectors and pins D0 and D1 of the Arduino to allow for programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Mostly for my own reference, the connections between a standard XLR3 or XLR5 connector and the Max485 pin are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;m-auto text-center table-fixed&#34;&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;w-1/3&#34;&gt;Net Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;w-1/3&#34;&gt;XLR Connector Pin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;w-1/3&#34;&gt;Max485 Pin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;&#34;&gt;GND&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;&#34;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Data - &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;&#34;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;&#34;&gt;Data +&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;&#34;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;&#34;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Here&#39;s what draft one of version 0.1 looked like when it came back from &lt;a href=&#34;https://oshpark.com/&#34;&gt;OSHPark&lt;/a&gt; and following assembly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-379 post-img&#34; src=&#34;FullSizeRender-1024x768.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;All the passives are 0603 and the max485 is an SOIC, both of which are pretty easy to solder by hand. The SMD switches are adorable! They&#39;re &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/c-k/JS202011SCQN/401-2002-1-ND/1640098&#34;&gt;these little guys from C&amp;amp;K&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The major flaw with version 0.1 is: one you&#39;ve attached headers, where do you attach anything else?? So version 0.2 added an additional row of thru-hole pads, cleaned up some labeling, and added some mounting holes for M2 screws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-380 post-img&#34; data-id=&#34;380&#34; data-link=&#34;https://jeff.glass/?attachment_id=380#main&#34; src=&#34;V02-Board.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-381 post-img&#34; data-id=&#34;381&#34; data-link=&#34;https://jeff.glass/?attachment_id=381#main&#34; src=&#34;V02-Schematic-1024x510.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;And once its all assembled, it looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-393 post-img&#34; src=&#34;IMG_7266-spun2-1024x768.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Programming&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve been making use of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceforge.net/p/dmxlibraryforar/wiki/Home/&#34;&gt;Conceptinetics DMX library&lt;/a&gt;, which I&#39;ve found to be both functional and stable. I haven&#39;t yet experimented with the RDM capabilities of that library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The library is very easy to use, and its usage is described well on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceforge.net/p/dmxlibraryforar/wiki/DMX%20Slave/&#34;&gt;Conceptinetics Documentation page&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, one defines a DMX_Slave object, which has enable(), setStartAddress(), and getChannelValue() methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;For example, once the object is set up and addressed, a loop() with the single command &lt;strong&gt;analogWrite(LED_PIN, getChannelValue(1));&lt;/strong&gt; will dim an LED attached to pin 9 dim in response to incoming DMX. Easy as pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Usage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;So, what can one do with an Arduino Pro Mini that can receive DMX? Well...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;You can make a DMX level monitor, a DMX controlled LED source. And really, anything else you can think of to do with an Arduino - drive servos, WS2812s, solenoids, relays...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The shield can also transmit DMX, though I haven&#39;t thoroughly tested this yet. But it&#39;s possible to make a miniature DMX controller, itty bitty light board, or testing tool. Or wire up some interesting input devices and make an interesting lighting controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;What&#39;s Next&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The shield has been a useful proving ground for the Conceptinetics DMX library (though we&#39;ve used it onstage before), as well as for OSHPark&#39;s manufacturing tolerances. I wasn&#39;t sure that having holes as close to the edge of the PCB as both V0.1 and V0.2 have would be manufacturable, but they came back no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;This all started for me with a miniature moving light project, and while that&#39;s not quite ready for a write-up, I&#39;ll just leave V0.3 of the DMX shield here. Not without errors/improvements to be made, but I&#39;m excited to try out some new LED dimming tech:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;aligncenter is-resized&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-397 post-img&#34; height=&#34;291&#34; src=&#34;IMG_7277-1024x768.jpg&#34; width=&#34;390&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
