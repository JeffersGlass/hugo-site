      <description>The Demilight (miniature moving light) project has been slowed down in the past few months, mostly by good things. Namely, my return to my fulltime job and other interesting technical nerdery. But the project soldiers on!
I made a video detailing the trials and tribulations of getting version 0.9.1 built, which you can watch below (embedded) or over on YouTube.

      <description>The newest round of Demilight PCBs and 3D-Prints have taken shape as version 0.8.1. Here&#39;s a brief video overview of the current state of thing:

The biggest change, as I mention in the video, is that I tried out JLCPCB&#39;s surface mount parts assembly service for the firs time. Overall, I&#39;m very satisfied, and I&#39;m delighted to have such a useful shortcut for assembly of these PCBs.</description>

      <title>DMX Mini Moving Light First Assembly - Live Stream</title>

      <description>With the shell 3D-printed and the PCB assembled, I went ahead and put together my first &#34;completed&#34; mini-moving light, live on camera:
{{&amp;lt; youtube lroMq1nJ0Ds &amp;gt;}}
It went fairly well - everything mostly worked and nothing caught fire!
There are a few mechanical and electrical takeaways for the next version, including:
Mechanical:Ennlarge the hole for LED wires in the lower caseMake a brief instruction manual for myself of what needs to be assembled/installed/solder in what orderHole for program/enable switch accessFix tolerances on the tilt-servo/yoke interfaceLengthen the body to accommodate a heatsink for the LED starFigure out mounting/hanging hardwareElectrical:Increase the spacing between Pan and Tilt Servo padsOrder higher-current 5V regulator (1.</description>

      <title>DMX Mini Moving Light Shield V0.3</title>
      <link>https://jeff.glass/backup-post/dmx-mini-moving-light-shield-v0.3/</link>

      <description>As I hinted to in my original post about the Arduino Pro Mini DMX Shield, and then talked some about in my PCB Assembly Livestream, the latest version of my DMX shield is geared toward driving in miniature moving light. This means that, in addition to being able to receive DMX, the Arduino driving the device will need to be able to drive a couple of servos and dim a relatively high power LED.</description>
