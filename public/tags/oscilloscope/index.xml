      <description>This is Part 2 of an N-part series. See also [Part 1].
In part one of this series, we began the process of developing a replacement for the LASCAR EM-4-LED 4-digit industrial 7 segment display. To recap: we mined the display&#39;s datasheet for all it we could, then opened up the device to reveal its component parts and continued to dig into their datasheets until we had a reasonably complete view of the device&#39;s functions.</description>

      <description>Between 10 years working in stage lighting, live video, and theatrical special effects; three moves and two home workbench-overhauls; and my new-this-month position as an Exhibit Engineer at a major Midwest science museum, I&#39;ve planned and kitted-out many electronics workbenches over the years. For those interested in getting involved in hobby or professional electronics work, I&#39;ve compiled the tools I think are most useful when building up a workspace for electronics construction and troubleshooting.</description>
