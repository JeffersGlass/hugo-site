      <description>The Demilight (miniature moving light) project has been slowed down in the past few months, mostly by good things. Namely, my return to my fulltime job and other interesting technical nerdery. But the project soldiers on!
I made a video detailing the trials and tribulations of getting version 0.9.1 built, which you can watch below (embedded) or over on YouTube.</description>

      <description>In BC times (Before Covid), I had often dreamed of setting up a semi-regular gathering with some nerd friends to make things. We&#39;d all sit around, drink beer, eat trail mix, and bash things together with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis and servos and LEDs and what have you. And then March 2020 rolled around - getting together in person was suddenly passé, but with my day job sending us home for &#34;</description>

      <description>The newest round of Demilight PCBs and 3D-Prints have taken shape as version 0.8.1. Here&#39;s a brief video overview of the current state of thing:
  
The biggest change, as I mention in the video, is that I tried out JLCPCB&#39;s surface mount parts assembly service for the firs time. Overall, I&#39;m very satisfied, and I&#39;m delighted to have such a useful shortcut for assembly of these PCBs. The version 0.</description>

      <description>This is Part 2 of an N-part series. See also [Part 1].
In part one of this series, we began the process of developing a replacement for the LASCAR EM-4-LED 4-digit industrial 7 segment display. To recap: we mined the display&#39;s datasheet for all it we could, then opened up the device to reveal its component parts and continued to dig into their datasheets until we had a reasonably complete view of the device&#39;s functions.</description>
