      <description>The newest round of Demilight PCBs and 3D-Prints have taken shape as version 0.8.1. Here&#39;s a brief video overview of the current state of thing:

The biggest change, as I mention in the video, is that I tried out JLCPCB&#39;s surface mount parts assembly service for the firs time. Overall, I&#39;m very satisfied, and I&#39;m delighted to have such a useful shortcut for assembly of these PCBs.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been quite awhile since the mini-moving light project (now renamed The Demilight) has been written up on the blog. The project was in hiatus for a few months while dove into the technical challenges of a new job, but as the job isn&#39;t keeping quite as busy at the moment (here in early summer 2020), it&#39;s back on the workbench. I&#39;ve put together a video showcasing the current state of the project, now in version 0.</description>

      <title>ETC Console Output Counts</title>

      <description>What follows is a list of output-counts for ETC Eos Family consoles. Because I&#39;m always needing to reference this information, and I want to be lazy when I need to find it. So, without further ado, here&#39;s the current output capacity for different ETC consoles, as of July 24, 2019:.tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;} .tg .tg-buh4{background-color:#f9f9f9;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-btxf{background-color:#f9f9f9;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top}

      <description>With the shell 3D-printed and the PCB assembled, I went ahead and put together my first &#34;completed&#34; mini-moving light, live on camera:

It went fairly well - everything mostly worked and nothing caught fire!
There are a few mechanical and electrical takeaways for the next version, including:
Mechanical:Ennlarge the hole for LED wires in the lower caseMake a brief instruction manual for myself of what needs to be assembled/installed/solder in what orderHole for program/enable switch accessFix tolerances on the tilt-servo/yoke interfaceLengthen the body to accommodate a heatsink for the LED starFigure out mounting/hanging hardwareElectrical:Increase the spacing between Pan and Tilt Servo padsOrder higher-current 5V regulator (1.</description>

      <title>DMX Mini Moving Light Shield V0.3</title>

      <description>As I hinted to in my original post about the Arduino Pro Mini DMX Shield, and then talked some about in my PCB Assembly Livestream, the latest version of my DMX shield is geared toward driving in miniature moving light. This means that, in addition to being able to receive DMX, the Arduino driving the device will need to be able to drive a couple of servos and dim a relatively high power LED.</description>

      <description>Last night, as I started to assemble V0.3 of my DMX Mini-Mover Shield, I thought it might be fun to switch on my webcam and stream the assembly live to the World Wide Web. What follows is about 80 minutes of unstructured benchwork, chatting about DMX, sACN, and circuitry, and a first test of the new LED dimming circuit. Will it light up, or will it go boom? Watch the video to find out:</description>

      <title>Lighting Control Protocols and Standards</title>
      <link>https://jeff.glass/backup-post/lighting-control-protocols-and-standards/</link>

      <guid>https://jeff.glass/backup-post/lighting-control-protocols-and-standards/</guid>
      <description>The world of stage lighting uses a variety of communication protocols to link control devices (computers, light boards, houselighting systems) to endpoint devices (lights, dimmers, effects). These run the gamut from basic analog control through legacy serial protocols to modern packetized, ethernet-based protocols.
The specifications of many of the most widely-adopted protocols are managed by the Entertainment Services and Technology Association through their Technical Standards Program. Confusing matters slightly, these protocols are sometimes referred to by their ESTA standards numbers, often interchangeably with the common names.</description>
