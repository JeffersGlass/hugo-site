      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;In BC times (&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;efore &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;ovid), I had often dreamed of setting up a semi-regular gathering with some nerd friends to make things. We&#39;d all sit around, drink beer, eat trail mix, and bash things together with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis and servos and LEDs and what have you. And then March 2020 rolled around - getting together in person was suddenly passé, but with my day job sending us home for &#34;three weeks&#34; of shelter-at-home, I also had a lot more time on my hands...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;And so, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/electronics-bash/&#34;&gt;Electronics Bash live video classes&lt;/a&gt; were born. Starting Sunday, March 15, I begin streaming live electronics classes every Sunday night. They have centered around Arduino programming and usage, but I&#39;ve also branched off into electrical theory, battery types, microcontroller hardware, and other related topics. After 20 weeks of that, I shifted gears to Raspberry Pi programming and single board computers. Many of the topics have been suggested by the small but enthusiastic core group of nerds who come together on Sunday nights to share ideas and learn things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-841 post-img&#34; height=&#34;405&#34; src=&#34;3-29-2020-Thumb-1024x576.png&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;It&#39;s now late-August 2020, I&#39;ve taught 22 of these classes, I&#39;m back at my day job, and having &#34;completed&#34; the Arduino course, it feels like I&#39;ve created &#34;one whole thing&#34; . And so I thought it might be a fun time to look back at what I&#39;ve learned about online teaching, streaming setups, electronics, and life over the first 22 Electronics Bash classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Some of this is going to be technical, some philosophical, some nonsensical. But what else is new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;span clas=&#34;m-auto&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-1296 size-large post-img&#34; height=&#34;405&#34; src=&#34;streamcap1-1024x576.png&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;The stream looks pretty good these days, I like to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;text-3xl&#34;&gt;Technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;My technology setup has been relatively consistent since about week 4 of Electronics Bash, with a few adjustments along the way as noted below. Let&#39;s break it down by technology categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;(&lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;My setup in many areas changed significantly with the shift to Raspberry Pi classes, so all those changes are noted at the end of this section.&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;When I leapt into the idea of teaching these classes, the thought was to focus on &#34;Arduino, Electronics, and Related Stuff.&#34; I knew I would need at least two things to be visible: a computer desktop (for the programming IDE and explanatory slides) and the workbench itself (for showing wiring and physical demos). Seeing my face I&#39;d count as a bonus. I also wanted to stream in reasonably high resolution - 720p as a goal, 1080p would be nice - and to make the process of switching between what the viewer is seeing as seamless as possible. Most topics would involve a good amount of swapping back and forth between slides, code, the workbench, and verbal explanation. And it should all look reasonably clear and clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The setup that I came up with has served me well in these regards over time, and wasn&#39;t terribly complicated nor expensive to put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Computer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I use my &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3lk85P0&#34;&gt;Lenovo Legion Y7000&lt;/a&gt; laptop for basically all my computer purposes these days, including streaming and programming. It&#39;s a &#34;gaming laptop&#34;, which essentially means it has a mid-tier GPU stuffed inside a laptop chassis with some extra fans. I personally like the versatility this gives me - I can run &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview&#34;&gt;Fusion360&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview&#34;&gt;AutoCAD&lt;/a&gt; pretty well, rendering a video out from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/&#34;&gt;Da Vinci Resolve&lt;/a&gt; is pretty efficient, and my setup is still portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Lenovo Legion Y7000P-1060 - Notebookcheck.net External Reviews&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;256&#34; src=&#34;https://www.notebookcheck.net/typo3temp/_processed_/a/3/csm__MG_3512_b10bc87ad6.jpg&#34; width=&#34;341&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I have an external monitor more or less permanently behind my workbench to accommodate the streaming setup - it&#39;s a basic 1600x900 monitor that I picked up from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freegeekchicago.org/&#34;&gt;FreeGeek Chicago&lt;/a&gt; at some point, just fed from the HDMI output on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter wp-image-1313 size-large post-img&#34; height=&#34;540&#34; src=&#34;IMG_0986-1024x768.jpg&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Cameras&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;My stream setup centers around two primary views- looking at something on the workbench (with my face in a little window in the corner) and looking at something on the computer (with my face in a little window in the corner). Sometimes, it&#39;s looking at my face alone, but that&#39;s mostly for the beginning and end of the class, and any long explanations in the middle. The full list of stream looks is below, but these are the big two/three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;To achieve these core looks, I have three cameras: two &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3lk86T1&#34;&gt;Logitech c920 HD webcams&lt;/a&gt; as the face-cameras, and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3hJiFwV&#34;&gt;Sony a5100 mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt; feeding an &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2G03QrH&#34;&gt;Elgato CamLink 4k HDMI capture dongle&lt;/a&gt; pointing straight down at the workbench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The c920s are both mounted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2477180&#34;&gt;3D-printed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3015022&#34;&gt;reposition-able arms&lt;/a&gt;, which mount to some 2020 aluminum extrusion that clips onto the front of my workbench shelves. They&#39;re really decent face cameras, with a wide field-of-view and decent autofocus. It&#39;s a shame that the Logitech drivers don&#39;t like to save their settings very well, so I end up needing to reconfigure things like color temperature and gain every time I restart my streaming software. But that&#39;s only an annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;You can see both &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2YB3Qoe&#34;&gt;ducting tape&lt;/a&gt; (NOT duct tape) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.gopherstagelighting.com/city-theatrical-black-tak/&#34;&gt;Black Tack&lt;/a&gt; in the pictures below, used as barn-doors to shield the cameras from the nearby lights to avoid flare. I have one for when I&#39;m working at the workbench and another for when I&#39;m looking at the laptop screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter wp-image-1300 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;IMG_0951-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The a5100 is usually attached to an &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2QsvSOw&#34;&gt;11&#34; magic arm&lt;/a&gt; with a soft-clamp on a higher shelf; I also have a&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3jh3r2u&#34;&gt; desktop boom-arm&lt;/a&gt; for filming things up-close, but I almost never stream that way. I originally had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/31uNL5D&#34;&gt;cheaper, plastic-y 11&#34; magic arm&lt;/a&gt;, in the theory that I wasn&#39;t sure if it would actually be useful. Turns out they&#39;re a great tool, but the cheapiest ones wear out pretty quick - the metal ones like the one linked above are worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1301 post-img&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;IMG_0961-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3gtAiiM&#34;&gt;kit OSS 18-55mm lens&lt;/a&gt; that the A5100 came with - with &#34;digital true zoom&#34; providing another 2x magnification beyond the longest zoom range, I find I get a really good range of full-desk to close-up-on-table. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/34Ah5JZ&#34;&gt;battery-replacer&lt;/a&gt; (wall-wart-to-battery-form-&lt;wbr/&gt;factor-plug) is a must for streaming, because any internal battery is going to die very quickly. The a5100 also requires a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2YFRBXw&#34;&gt;micro-HDMI to HDMI cable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Software&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/&#34;&gt;Open Broadcast System (OBS)&lt;/a&gt; as my primary streaming software. I find it does most everything I want it to, and a couple other things besides. Since I&#39;m not monetizing my streams at all, and don&#39;t need features like pop-up notifications when somebody throws me some digi-chits or something, I don&#39;t feel the need to switch to something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://streamlabs.com/&#34;&gt;Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://streamelements.com/&#34;&gt;Stream Elements&lt;/a&gt;. But perhaps someday I should play with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter wp-image-1311 size-large post-img&#34; height=&#34;408&#34; src=&#34;obs-with-chat-cropped-1024x580.png&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;As I mentioned above, my big 3 scenes are: Computer Screen (+ small face), Workbench (with small face), and Face (With small computer screen and workbench). But I have 13 different scenes in my active collection; for the sake of completeness, they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;post-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just facecam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facecam with small workbench and laptop views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Just workbench&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workbench with small facecam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workbench with small facecam and laptop views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just laptop screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laptop with small facecam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laptop screen with small facecam and workbench views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi Display with small facecam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;Video Adjustments in Progress&#34; slide with microphone ON - &lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;I use this mostly when I need to stand up from my workbench to grab something on the shelves behind it, and I don&#39;t want viewers to be staring at my tummy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;We&#39;ll Be Right Back&#34; slide with Microphone OFF and music on - &lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;For times I actually need to step away for a moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;&#34;&lt;/span&gt;Stream Starting Soon&#34; slide with countdown to start&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;Goodnight&#34; slide - &lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;for end of streams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Switching between the various views smoothly on the fly as necessary to explain a concept is, I think, critical to maintaining flow. For that, I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck-mobile&#34;&gt;Stream Deck Mobile app&lt;/a&gt; for my iPhone, which emulates a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck&#34;&gt;Stream Deck controller&lt;/a&gt;. The Stream Deck configuration app is easy to use if just a little bit buggy - it allows me to have up to 15 buttons on my phone which switch between scenes in OBS on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m-auto text-center&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-1312 size-large post-img&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; src=&#34;IMG_0987-1024x473.png&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;My Streamdeck App configuration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;To do the &#34;Starting Soon&#34; and &#34;waiting for stragglers to arrive&#34; countdowns, I use a little script called &lt;a href=&#34;https://montemagno.com/introducing-my-stream-timer-a-countdown-timer-for-obs/&#34;&gt;My Stream Timer&lt;/a&gt;, which updates a .txt file with the current countdown time and specified by some very basic controls. OBS then uses this text file as the source for some text that appears on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Lighting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I spent more than a decade as a stage lighting professional before shifting gears into my current job. As such, I have opinions about lighting.  Of all the physical elements of my setup, this is the one that&#39;s changed most over time. But thankfully, it doesn&#39;t take a ton of cash to make a halfway decent lighting environment, particularly when you&#39;re in charge of your own camera angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;One good rule of thumb for video that&#39;s meant to be clear and communicative - get a lot of light on your subject, and get light off of whatever&#39;s behind your subject. In my case, I have an &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2CZtyLG&#34;&gt;11W 6500K LED bulb&lt;/a&gt; strung above my workbench as the primary bench light, as well as a small LED A-lamp fixture that used to be in a bedroom as some fill light. These just blast the bench with light, and allow me to turn the ISO on my camera down to keep the grain away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter wp-image-1314 size-large post-img&#34; height=&#34;540&#34; src=&#34;IMG_0988-1024x768.jpg&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;On my face, I have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/32pAURv&#34;&gt;small LED gooseneck&lt;/a&gt; that was on an alternate workbench in my last apartment. Hanging above my chair is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2QtsMtG&#34;&gt;clip light&lt;/a&gt; with another cool-while LED acting as a hair light. Finally, down near my left knee is a small clip light with a blue LED bulb, which acts as a fill light when I turn 45 degrees to look at my laptop screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1303 post-img&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;IMG_0958-225x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;225&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The background behind your subject doesn&#39;t need to be totally dark, though relative darkness does help with contrast. Creating color contrast can help draw a figure out from the background as well. To that end, I have some &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2EzEpfO&#34;&gt;RGB LED tape&lt;/a&gt; (with only blue and green hardwired on) on my storage shelves that sit behind me on camera, and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3hrwcsC&#34;&gt;red LED PAR bulb&lt;/a&gt; that scrapes up my blinds for some additional color and texture. Just provides a little additional pop and saturation to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1305 post-img&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;IMG_0959-225x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;225&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;All together this adds up to what I feel is a balanced lighting look, that keeps my face visible and clear, illuminates the desktop, and hopefully doesn&#39;t look &lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;too&lt;/span&gt; cheesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter wp-image-1307 size-large post-img&#34; height=&#34;404&#34; src=&#34;streamcap3-1024x574.png&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;text-xl&#34;&gt;Audio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;For the first 16 weeks or so of classes, my microphone setup was incredibly inexpensive - a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3linOhn&#34;&gt;wired BOYA lavalier&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3gvgnA2&#34;&gt;generic USB Audio Interface&lt;/a&gt; that a picked up when I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://kk9jef.wordpress.com/2015/10/20/enabling-a-usb-sound-card-on-the-raspberry-pi/&#34;&gt;experimenting with Audio input to the Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; a few years back. I like the BOYA a lot for the price - decent response, nice long cable, fairly durable. More decently, I&#39;ve been used a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3jeF5Gv&#34;&gt;Fifine wireless boom-style microphone&lt;/a&gt;, which gives me a little more freedom to move around, but the low-frequency response isn&#39;t nearly as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m-auto text-center&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-1308 size-large post-img&#34; height=&#34;405&#34; src=&#34;streamcap4-1024x576.png&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;I&#39;m not in love with the look of the boom mic, but it does its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;To make things sound just a little rounder, use a couple of OBS&#39;s built-in VST audio plugins - EQ and Compressor - to keep the frequency response pleasant and the volume to a reasonable level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I used an &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/31rQSv4&#34;&gt;inexpensive pair of over-the-ear headphones&lt;/a&gt; to hear myself and any notification sounds that come up. They&#39;re pretty darn good for headphones that cost less than $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I enjoy having a little background music on my stream, just to fill air and make things a little more cozy. All of it is pulled from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music&#34;&gt;YouTube&#39;s music library&lt;/a&gt;, which guarantees I won&#39;t be hit with an obscure copyright strike someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;post-h4&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi Class Adjustments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;When I start the Raspberry Pi classes, I&#39;m wanted to capture the HDMI output directly from the Pi into the capture software as well, so I went ahead and picked up one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3aYYc4D&#34;&gt;$20 HDMI capture dongles&lt;/a&gt; that have popped up from overseas in the past couple months. The thing works really amazingly well for how inexpensive it is - decent color, framerate, resolution, HDCP support... I&#39;ve had no issues with it so far, and at least on my system the automatically-installed drivers work just fine. There does seem to be about 200ms of lag going into OBS, but for desktop instruction this is just fine. If you were using it to capture the output of an external camera, it might be necessary to delay your audio to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m-auto text-center&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1309 post-img&#34; height=&#34;265&#34; src=&#34;hdmi-300x265.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;It could not look any more generic, but it actually works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;For my very first RPi class, I interacted with the Pi via OBS - that is, my view of the Raspberry Pi&#39;s desktop was inside of my streaming output inside of OBS. This wasn&#39;t ideal. The display is, of course, somewhat shrunk down; worse, the slight lag made the interface feel very floaty and hard to use. By the next class, I had dropped an &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/32H5t5p&#34;&gt;HDMI splitter&lt;/a&gt; in between the Pi and the capture card, whose second output feeds a second external monitor. So now I have my laptop screen (where slides/IDE live), my streaming screen (HDMI output from laptop, where OBS/chat lives) and a Raspberry Pi screen (showing Pi desktop). This works really quite well as an interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Sometime I had discovered during my initial setup about USB video sources and USB hubs has also popped up again with this setup. I won&#39;t claim to fully understand the issue, but something about t&lt;a href=&#34;https://superuser.com/questions/497933/50-usb-webcams-in-a-single-computer-is-that-really-possible&#34;&gt;he way USB 2.0/3.0 handle video streaming resources&lt;/a&gt; is less than ideal. The result is that putting multiple video devices (webcams, capture cards) into the same USB port on a computer (via a hub) doesn&#39;t necessarily allow them to utilize all the available bandwidth, so having multiple video devices on one hub can be a problem. &lt;a href=&#34;https://yokim.net/3231/&#34;&gt;This blog post by Yokim&lt;/a&gt; encapsulates the same experiences I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;My workaround for this is to have two of the video sources on the same hub, and then only ever activate one of them at a time. The two I chose are the webcam which shows my face when I&#39;m looking at my laptop, and the cheapie capture card bringing in the Raspberry Pi desktop. These are the two feeds I think I&#39;m least likely to ever need at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m-auto text-center&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-1316 size-large post-img&#34; height=&#34;540&#34; src=&#34;IMG_0989-1024x768.jpg&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;I had to take both monitors off their OEM stands to fit them under the lowest shelf in my workspace. Currently fitting them with 3D-printed stands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;text-3xl&#34;&gt;Teaching: In Person vs. Streaming vs. Zooming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;There was a time in my life that I thought I was going to be a school teacher. All of my summer jobs in high-school involved teaching a theater camp for kids and teens. Many of my college classes focused on &#34;teaching artist&#34; work, theater for young audiences, and pedagogical theory. I even accidentally ended up in a &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;How to Teach High School English&lt;/span&gt;&#34; class in college that was meant for M.S.Ed. students, and stuck it out because it was so fascinating. And while that&#39;s not ultimately the direction my career has lead me at the moment, I&#39;ve always had an interest in teaching skills and sharing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;There&#39;s been a real learning curve to teaching a course online though. And in my case, teaching it via stream, which I think is worth distinguishing from teaching via Zoom (or one of its thousand clones), which I&#39;ll shorten to &#39;Zooming.&#39; When one is Zooming, whether with friends or students, there&#39;s still a modicum of feedback, even when no ones saying something. You can see faces. You can see confusion or comprehension. You can roughly gather whether a class is engaged or lost or checked out or eager for what&#39;s next. It&#39;s a poor substitute for in-person lessons, I think, but at least there&#39;s still some faces in the digital crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;In a streaming setup like I use, none of that is guaranteed. I spend a good chunk of my classes essentially talking to myself, and assuming it&#39;s being absorbed on the other side of the internet. Which is not to say the participants are unresponsive - they&#39;re wonderfully good about asking questions, poking fun, chiming in, giving suggestions. But especially for more complex topics, it&#39;s difficult to not be able to look into somebody&#39;s eyes every 30 seconds and make sure they&#39;re following along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Classes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSuMkkyTpvA&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2JppZIh6Cw&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0cF5v9Pnyo&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; on Interrupts and Timers are a great example of these challenges. These topics are super interesting (I think), but they&#39;re fairly dense. You need to understand a little bit about program flow, a little bit about memory, a little bit about hardware, and a little bit about timing to understand them. All of which we covered. But it&#39;s the kind of thing where one wants to ask &#34;Does that make sense? Are we all following?&#34; after each tidbit... and that&#39;s just not practical or actionable in a streaming environment. Especially with 6-10 seconds of lag between question and response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;text-3xl&#34;&gt;Dealing with Errors: Doing it live&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;In teaching over 60 hours of live classes at this point, some errors were inevitable. Especially in an electronics course where I think it&#39;s valuable to build up the circuits, code, and understanding in real time. No matter how much I prep, experiment, and try to plan, there is inevitably going to be something that goes wrong. Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The challenge, then, is what to do when something fails? I personally find it throws me very much off my game - but I&#39;ve consistently gotten feedback that the process of working through problems on camera is actually super useful to those watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve wondered as part of these classes if a whole stream on just &#34;Troubleshooting&#34; would be valuable, but I think the more useful version of that is to make an earnest effort to solve the real issues as they come up. Of course, spending 20 minutes tracking down typos would suck. Those are the times I pull out a cake-I-baked-earlier version of the code. But most errors can be fixed quickly, and talking out how to find them - &#34;Oh, this error message usually means...&#34; &#34;Oh, this behavior is wrong because...&#34; is valuable to those learning to code and wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;text-3xl&#34;&gt;Lesson Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Anyone who&#39;s ever built a course from scratch (&lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;and I know that&#39;s what a lot of traditionally-in-person instructors are doing these days!) &lt;/span&gt;knows how time consuming it is. First to make sure you fully understand the topic for a given lesson. Then to synthesize that knowledge into a logical sequence of explanations, topics, and themes. And finally to reify those ideas into tangible explanations and demos. Especially with a sweeping topic like &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/KiQKojmzBRs&#34;&gt;Fundamentals of Electricity&lt;/a&gt;- where do you even start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m-auto text-center&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-1319 size-large post-img&#34; height=&#34;404&#34; src=&#34;resistnace-1024x575.png&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;This did end up being a really fun week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Especially since I was making these classes up as I went along, week to week, my process typically looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;post-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous Saturday - identify a potential theme for the &lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;following&lt;/span&gt; week&#39;s lesson; ruminate, ponder while finalizing the &lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; week&#39;s lesson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;Sunday is stream-day - focus on the day&#39;s lesson. Possibly announce the next week&#39;s lesson if feeling very confident&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday/Tuesday - Do broad research, identify gaps in current knowledge (&lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;&#39;wait I didn&#39;t know that was a thing&#39;&lt;/span&gt;), form idea of scope of topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wednesday - Start prepping slides with specific research, rearranging and re-shaping the lesson order as they form. Announce stream on Facebook/YouTube&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thursday/Friday - Finalize slides while starting to build demo circuits, programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday - Finish building demo circuits, test that they can be built in real time for stream. Start pondering the following week...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday - STREAM IT!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;text-3xl&#34;&gt;Taking Breaks and &#39;Bye&#39; Days&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Writing a new 2-3 hour class every week and teaching it online would be exhausting enough, especially for someone a little rusty with teaching. Doing it in the throws of a Pandemic was... well, let&#39;s just say a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I really wanted to keep to the every-single-week schedule as much as I could, both for continuity of those watching and frankly to maintain some structure for myself as the world changed. To that end, I did 20 straight streams from March through the end of July, every single Sunday (well, 1 Monday). Which I felt great about, but I did need to find ways to give myself little breaks in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The outlet I came up with was taking what I thought of as &#39;bye weeks;&#39; like when a team is doing so well in a sports tournament that they&#39;re just &#34;assumed to have won&#34; they&#39;re week and advance automatically. I did this by selecting topics that I either knew well enough to be able to teach with minimal preparation, or that I had already taught for some other purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter wp-image-1320 size-large post-img&#34; height=&#34;404&#34; src=&#34;pcbs-1024x575.png&#34; width=&#34;720&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The two weeks that exemplified this were &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7fFieY7mFA&#34;&gt;Week 10: Write Better Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_772Sg5K8U&#34;&gt;Week 13: Creating a Printed Circuit Board&lt;/a&gt;. The former was essentially refactoring existing code in an IDE, a straightforward thing to do live. The latter was based on a lesson I had actually given at my previous job to some employees and interns. Both provided a little brain space in weeks where I was otherwise swamped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Now that I&#39;m back to work at my fulltime job, I&#39;ve elected to go to an every-other-weekend schedule, which gives me a lot more breathing room in terms of ruminating, absorbing, and developing the upcoming lessons. And I think the lessons themselves are turning out better for it. Slamming a lesson together in a week &lt;span class=&#34;italic&#34;&gt;on top of &lt;/span&gt; a 40-hour-a-week job would lead to some substandard teaching, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;text-3xl&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any better way to illuminate the holes in your knowledge of a topic than to try to teach that topic. Once you have to verbalize/write down/illustrate/demo a subject to someone who&#39;s never touched it before, you discover exactly what you&#39;ve always glossed over. What does happen in that edge case? What situations would cause this specific thing to happen? Why this and not that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Though I wouldn&#39;t have wished for the current state of the world, I&#39;m grateful to have spent so many Sundays in the last five-and-a-half months with other nerds, teaching, learning, and exploring. I hope we can do the same over beer and trail mix real soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting up an Electronics Lab - Tools</title>
      <link>https://jeff.glass/post/setting-up-an-electronics-lab-tools/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 23:54:53 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jeff.glass/post/setting-up-an-electronics-lab-tools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Between 10 years working in stage lighting, live video, and theatrical special effects; three moves and two &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/2019/03/03/home-office-overhaul/&#34;&gt;home workbench-overhauls; &lt;/a&gt;and my new-this-month position as an Exhibit Engineer at a major Midwest science museum, I&#39;ve planned and kitted-out many electronics workbenches over the years. For those interested in getting involved in hobby or professional electronics work, I&#39;ve compiled the tools I think are most useful when building up a workspace for electronics construction and troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I&#39;m going to specifically focus on tools and support-hardware this time around, and not dive too deep into supplies and consumables, purely to maintain focus. The parts and pieces you need will be wildly different if your specific focus is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jeriellsworth/status/1195900908049072128&#34;&gt;scratch-building accelerometers&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/2019/05/23/dmx-mini-moving-light-shield-v0-3/&#34;&gt;twitter-connected instant cameras&lt;/a&gt;, say. But in the wide and deep pool of &#39;working with electronics,&#39; here are some flotation aids that will keep your head above water most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34; id=&#34;soldering-header-h3&#34;&gt;Soldering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;As both hobbyists and professionals, we are often looking not for the best tool, but one that&#39;s good enough for the job without breaking the bank. If there&#39;s one tool that I&#39;d recommend getting the &#39;good&#39; versus the &#39;good enough&#39; version, it&#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;soldering iron&lt;/strong&gt;. I thought for years I was just bad at soldering. Nope, just a crappy $25 Radio Shack soldering iron that was doing me no favors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Not that &#39;good&#39; has to mean &#39;super expensive.&#39; In my home shop and my current shop at work, I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2DuvecD&#34;&gt;Hakko 888D&lt;/a&gt;, which has proved reliable and durable, even if the interface is a little unintuitive. For less than $100, that&#39;s a darn good iron. The shop at my previous job has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OWP8CF&#34;&gt;cheapie 3-in-1 soldering/hot-air-rework/power supply station&lt;/a&gt;, and for most things that was just &lt;em&gt;fine. &lt;/em&gt;They&#39;re such a huge leap above a &#39;soldering pencil,&#39; and they&#39;ll last for years,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Hakko 888D&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-673 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;IMG_8929-225x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;225&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;The trusty Hakko 888D. I now have one of these at home and one at work, and they&#39;re a very nice little iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Whatever iron you choose, you&#39;ll want some &lt;strong&gt;additional tips&lt;/strong&gt; to go with it. While you could get the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2P5kC9Q&#34;&gt;pack of every tip imaginable&lt;/a&gt;, I find myself using either the medium chisel or the fine-conical %99.9 of the time, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2r2h4Nj&#34;&gt;a smaller assortment&lt;/a&gt; is probably fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;As far as &lt;strong&gt;solder&lt;/strong&gt;, while there are good environmental reasons to go with lead-free solder, there&#39;s nothing quite so good to work with as classic &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OBtjcX&#34;&gt;Kester rosin-core 60/40, nice and thin&lt;/a&gt;. A one-pound reel of that stuff will last most people &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. While you could buy a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2DCC53L&#34;&gt;solder-reel stand&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve found a &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/2019/03/09/3d-printing-in-the-home-workshop/&#34;&gt;3D-printed design&lt;/a&gt; that I really like (credit to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:960103&#34;&gt;Phredie on Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Roll of Solder on 3D Printed Stand&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-674 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;IMG_8948-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;One pound of Kester 60/40 in my favorite 3D printed holder. As busy as we are, I might actually make in through this roll in a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;You&#39;ll also want some &lt;strong&gt;flux&lt;/strong&gt;, either &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35T3lHl&#34;&gt;as a paste&lt;/a&gt; or in my preferred form &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2rHoJk2&#34;&gt;as a solder pen&lt;/a&gt;. While rosin-core solder has flux built-in, any time you&#39;re doing rework, SMD work, or just taking a little longer to deal with a tricky part, flux makes sure your surfaces are clean and ready to accept the molten solder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Speaking of keeping things clean, let&#39;s talk about &lt;strong&gt;cleaning your soldering iron tip&lt;/strong&gt;. The sponge and &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35SyYkD&#34;&gt;wire-wool cleaner&lt;/a&gt; than come with your iron are plenty, if you treat your iron right. More aggressive chemical fluxes like those found in &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/33wfVLn&#34;&gt;tip-tinners and cleaner&lt;/a&gt;&#34; are meant to remove long-built-up oxidation on your iron tip, and are overkill for routine tip-cleaning. I was taught to dab the iron in the wire-wool between each joint (realistically, between every several joints), and wipe on the sponge before the iron goes back in the stand. That should be all you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;To remove solder from things other than your iron may take some special tools. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2DyQTQZ&#34;&gt;De-soldering braid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a great tool - its a woven copper ribbon impregnated with flux, that, when heated against a solder joint, sucks the molten solder up via capilary action. For getting the last little bit of solder out of through-hole pads, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OYKgwL&#34;&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;solder-sucker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the tool - find yourself a cheap one, they&#39;re all pretty much the same. At my last job, we purchased a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OYjkgL&#34;&gt;cheap vacuum desoldering station&lt;/a&gt;, which was fine, but mostly could have been replaced by solder-wick in 90% of applications. Perhaps a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2Du8FoA&#34;&gt;brand-name vacuum desoldering station&lt;/a&gt; would have done the job better, but in any case when setting up my shop at the new job, I passed on this tool. For more thoughts on all these tools/techniques, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwsGnO630vY&#34;&gt;W2AEW&lt;/a&gt; has a great video on desoldering if you find yourself in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Whether your soldering or desoldering, you&#39;re going to be making some nasty fumes melting all that flux, so get yourself some kind of &lt;strong&gt;filtering fan&lt;/strong&gt;. I&#39;ve got a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2L8wGpv&#34;&gt;dirt-cheap Aoyue filter-fan&lt;/a&gt; on my home bench, and both a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2rCkS8b&#34;&gt;cheap Kotto&lt;/a&gt; and an&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OXIlZo&#34;&gt; expensive Hakko&lt;/a&gt; on my bench at work now, and they&#39;re all about as good as each other, and they all suck (not in the way you want a filter fan to suck). I replaced the fan in my Aoyue with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35PoTVm&#34;&gt;120V 4&#34; Muffin fan&lt;/a&gt; (pulled from an closing musical&#39;s fog-distribution system, in my case), and it&#39;s made a world of difference, I highly recommend upgrading. Just be careful, those fans bite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Hakko FA-400 Fan&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-675 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;IMG_8927-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;Now that&#39;s a big fan! Inherited from a previous museum exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;There are about as many different kinds of &lt;strong&gt;work-holding clamps&lt;/strong&gt; as there are people who solder, but my two favorites are this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21357&#34;&gt;3D-printed PCB vise&lt;/a&gt; for flat-work and these &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2R8qkdl&#34;&gt;octopus-style 3rd-hands for other unusual shapes&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2R6nWDX&#34;&gt;classic Panavise clamps&lt;/a&gt;, and for a shared-shop environment I&#39;d recommend them for their sturdy build quality. But I find them to be a little bit too bulky and their jaws not quite wide enough for the work I find myself doing, so I opt for other solutions in my just-for-me setups. You do you though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-687 post-img&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; src=&#34;DSC00056-300x169.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Electronic Test and Measurement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The two big items in this category are multimeters and oscilloscopes. Let&#39;s take a look at both of them first before we get into some more specialized tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;There are lots and lots of good-enough &lt;strong&gt;multimeters&lt;/strong&gt; in the world today, of all kinds of different brands, and they&#39;re pretty much going to all be OK. Rather than try and pick out specific ones from Amazon, here are the features I&#39;d look for if I was looking to add a decent multimeter to my bench today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;post-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basics: AC/DC Voltage, AC/DC Current (up to 10A is useful), resistance (to 0.1Ω and 1 MΩ is nice).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuity test- this is &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;the most useful setting on a multimeter&lt;/span&gt;. Using this setting and touching a wire/component/circuit with the probes will tell you if there&#39;s a low impedance path between the two points; i.e., if they&#39;re connected. Super useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto power-off. Doesn&#39;t seem like much, but it&#39;s real easy to kill batteries without it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4-digit precision (some cheap meters only give 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The other features a meter might have include: temperature measurement, diode-forward-voltage measurement, True RMS AC measurement, frequency (power line), duty-cycle, capacitance, transistor hFE, illumination... the list goes on. I&#39;ve appreciated having a true RMS measurement in tricky AC power situations, and having an easy frequency-check can be handy, but for the rest of these, I&#39;d rather rely on a purpose-made tool like a thermometer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OXmoty&#34;&gt;lightmeter&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2r2n6NX&#34;&gt;transistor checker&lt;/a&gt;, rather than something built into my multimeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Multimeter&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-688 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;DSC00059-169x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;169&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;I got this meter almost 8 years ago in a moment of need, at a Menards if memory serves, and it&#39;s worked swell ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;If you&#39;ve got the cash and are looking for something to last 20 years, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2sy0SUz&#34;&gt;Fluke 117&lt;/a&gt; is a really solid primary meter. Fluke has been &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; brand name in quality meters for the past lots-of-years - well made, reliable, accurate. Not super cheap, but you do get what you pay for. My current department has standardized on them, and that&#39;s been swell. For most things, we don&#39;t need &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2Y0Q90F&#34;&gt;the $300+ meter&lt;/a&gt; (which gives you min/max tracking and microAmp measurement) or &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OSDNmQ&#34;&gt;the $500 meter&lt;/a&gt; (with its fancy clamps and probes). In fact, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2DA9tZ9&#34;&gt;basic $40 meter&lt;/a&gt; is going to be fine for almost everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;A little aside - why are there no benchtop-multimeters in the super-affordable price range? When you can get a passable, portable multimeter for $20, why are even the&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/34BhIA5&#34;&gt; cheapie-versions of a benchtop meter&lt;/a&gt; still $150? I think there would be a strong market for a $60, benchtop form-factor, ok-ish meter. I have an old Simpson 460-6 at work that I love using, not because it&#39;s the world&#39;s most amazing meter, but just because it&#39;s always &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; and the form factor is right. How about it, AliExpress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Simpson 460-6&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-689 post-img&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;IMG_8937-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;Now can I get this form factor, with a little adorable LED display, for less than $200?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Moving on to &lt;strong&gt;oscilloscopes&lt;/strong&gt;, I think there are some who would say they aren&#39;t essential for electronics work - after all, if you end up working mostly with digital signals, or analog-voltages that don&#39;t change over time, is it really worth it? I would counter that &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;the oscilloscope is your eyes into the realm of what your electronics are doing&lt;/span&gt;, and is a vitally useful tool in many situations. If you&#39;ve never used an oscilloscope, may I once again recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=067W7h1BhxE&#34;&gt;a video by W2AEW.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Scopes are another arena where you don&#39;t need to break the bank to get something decent enough to use. My first scope was a well-aged &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scribd.com/document/364412737/BK-Precision-1535a&#34;&gt;BK-Precision 1535A&lt;/a&gt; 35Mhz analog scope that a bought from a guy on Craigslist for about $40. For basic electronics work, 20Mhz or so is plenty - you&#39;re most likely going to working at slower speeds (audio to 20Khz, maybe 250kHz for serial or RS485) or much, much higher (HDMI, USB, etc) where a scope really isn&#39;t the right tool in most cases anyway. Or at least, once you&#39;ve progressed to the level where you&#39;re worrying about measuring GHz signals, you&#39;ve likely acquired more specialized tooling along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-690 post-img&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; src=&#34;DSC00061-300x169.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;This old thing is still puttering away on my workbench. Still worked just fine for most things I&#39;d care to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I think a decent analog scope is a really good place to start if you&#39;ve never used a scope before - better to tackle the fundamentals of the tool before having to learn how to use a particular menu structure as well. The shop at my new job came with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/test-measurement/oscilloscopes/compactscope-series-v-1565/&#34;&gt;Hitachi V1565 100MHz analog scope&lt;/a&gt; with measurement capability that I&#39;ve been very happy with - the ability to add cursors to an analog display to measure voltage, time, or duty cycle is handy. At home I&#39;ve now also got an &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35O2ZBV&#34;&gt;Owon PDS5022T&lt;/a&gt; 25MHz digital scope that was gifted to me - I like the tools having a digital scope provides, but I find it significantly more clunky than either of the classic analog scopes in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Hitachi 1565&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-676 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;IMG_8930-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;The &#34;new&#34; (to me) oscilloscpe I have at work. 100MHz bandwidth is overkill for anything I can think we&#39;ll run into, but you never know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;So, if you&#39;re looking for a bench scope and you&#39;ve never used one before, I&#39;d say start analog. I see on eBay right now you can buy a gently-loved 2-channel analog scope for around $50-60 (plus $40 shipping, those things aren&#39;t light). Not a bad way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Something my accomplice at my old job turned me on to is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/s?k=portable+oscilloscope&#34;&gt;small, portable oscilloscopes&lt;/a&gt;. I don&#39;t have a specific model to recommend, but they can be useful in specific circumstances - not so much to actually interrogate the characteristics of a signal, but more as a signal checker. Do I have AC here, do I have something that looks like RS-485 there, etc? If you do buy one, make sure you get one with an integrated battery (not all do) - getting one that still has to be plugged in makes it far less useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;There are some more niche electronic tools that I make use of on my bench, but mostly because of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://kk9jef.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;ham radio background&lt;/a&gt;. A decent &lt;strong&gt;frequency counter&lt;/strong&gt; is useful in that arena - I&#39;ve got a classic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okMwS4IXz5E&#34;&gt;Heathkit IM-2420&lt;/a&gt; that I picked up at a swap-meet, but I&#39;m really intrigued by the new wave of &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2L8CJdv&#34;&gt;inexpensive benchtop frequency counters&lt;/a&gt; that have popped up in the past couple years that claim to do 0.1Hz-2.4GHz for only $70. A &lt;strong&gt;signal genetor&lt;/strong&gt; is also really useful in my work - I &lt;a href=&#34;https://kk9jef.wordpress.com/2017/07/10/si5351-signal-generator/&#34;&gt;built my own&lt;/a&gt; around an Si5351 and an Arduino, but you can buy a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Generator-KKmoon-Precision-Dual-Channel-Arbitrary/dp/B071HJ31WN/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=function+generator&amp;amp;qid=1575140813&amp;amp;sr=8-7&#34;&gt;0-25Mhz&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35QquKJ&#34;&gt;0-60Mhz arbitrary function generator&lt;/a&gt; for not a lot of cash these days, and I have colleagues who speak highly of both. Since my last job was more lighting-focused, we purchased an&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2rFIskp&#34;&gt; Extech &lt;strong&gt;digital lightmeter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a specific project - sometime I&#39;d love to get into why that specific meter and the challenges of metering LED sources, but that discussion is too long for this margin to contain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-692 post-img&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; src=&#34;DSC00063-300x169.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;Some specialized tools for specialized circumstances. A sweep generator, frequency counter, DC power supply, oscilloscope, and homebrew frequency generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Electrical Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;A source of consistant, controlled &lt;strong&gt;DC power&lt;/strong&gt; is vital for electronics work, since most projects are going to be some flavor of DC-powered. For basic logic-level type work, the least-expensive option is probably an &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2Y3Rvre&#34;&gt;ATX computer power supply&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OCwelj&#34;&gt;ATX breakout board&lt;/a&gt;, which will at least provide +3.3, +5, +12 and -12V, which suffices for a lot of Arduino+sensors or Raspberry Pi+breakouts type projects. There are a thousand flavors of those breakout boards, so make sure you find one with the ATX connector type that matches your power supply. There are also screw terminal and terminal lug versions, if you have strong feelings either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;If your work is less module-oriented and more about building up circuits in a more from-scratch way, a &lt;strong&gt;current-limited bench power supply&lt;/strong&gt; is key. A decent power supply will supply relatively low-ripple DC voltage from 0 to 20 or 30 or 50 volts, at 5 or 10 amps max, commonly. What&#39;s more, you can set a current-limit such that, when your project runs away and tries to turn itself into a pile of smoke, at least it does so more slowly - the power supply will typically fold back its output voltage to keep the output current below the value you specify. Some fancier models also have the option to just cut off current entirely until the power supply is reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;DC power Supply&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-700 post-img&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; src=&#34;DSC00064-300x169.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;Versions of this Yescom power supply are available all over the internet at around the $50 price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;My current recommended inexpensive bench power supply is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/33AshSr&#34;&gt;Hanmatek HM305P&lt;/a&gt;, for a couple reasons - having a digital display so you can set the output voltage at, say, exactly 5V, is handy. As are the six front-panel preset buttons that allow you to jump to commonly-used voltage/current limit combinations that you specify. That said, at home I have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2RaiPmy&#34;&gt;Yescom power supply&lt;/a&gt; with a somewhat higher output current that&#39;s useful for &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/2018/08/25/50w-qrp-amplifier-schematic-pcb-ver-1/&#34;&gt;testing RF amplifiers&lt;/a&gt;, and its analog controls make it somewhat easier to smoothly vary to the output voltage and see how a circuit/amplifier reacts. If I had to choose only one, I&#39;d get the Hanmatek (or one of its many clones), but an analog-controlled meter is handy for certain situations. (I got by with an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ebay.com/p/581276384?iid=183982778513&amp;amp;chn=ps&amp;amp;norover=1&amp;amp;mkevt=1&amp;amp;mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&amp;amp;mkcid=2&amp;amp;itemid=183982778513&amp;amp;targetid=596465712468&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;mktype=pla&amp;amp;googleloc=9021730&amp;amp;poi=&amp;amp;campaignid=6470719577&amp;amp;mkgroupid=81597521270&amp;amp;rlsatarget=aud-649939740844:pla-596465712468&amp;amp;abcId=1140476&amp;amp;merchantid=6296724&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA5o3vBRBUEiwA9PVzav8LHOT-RAFp0R2EWk4GEyvkj8gsyByKg8dUNdnkEM4ogZbQpqIXsBoCiwkQAvD_BwE&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Elenco Precision XP-656&lt;/a&gt; 500mA 0-30V DC supply as my primary current-limited supply for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Hanmatek Power Supply&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-702 post-img&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;IMG_8925-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;The Hanmatek interface (top right) is a little unintuitive, but the manual is decently written. It&#39;s sitting on top of an older tri-voltage power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;To connect your power supply to your board, you&#39;re going to need an &lt;strong&gt;assortment of wires and connectors&lt;/strong&gt;. A handful of the typical USB cable types (A-to-Mini, A-to-B, A-to-Micro) is useful, and you probably already have them floating around in your sock drawer. Generic &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2DA4987&#34;&gt;alligator clips&lt;/a&gt; are always handy. &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/34GIOpA&#34;&gt;Mini-grabber style test leads&lt;/a&gt; are great for hooking to component leads on a breadboard, though they&#39;re not rated for much current - in those cases, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2DA4Jmj&#34;&gt;beefier clip lead&lt;/a&gt; is a better choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;While most projects are going to be DC powered, having enough AC outlets to have all of your test gear plugged in all the time, plus plenty of outlets for temporary plugs, plus a few more, is a tremendous timesaver. You can snag a&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35Sd0xW&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; multi-outlet power strip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for relatively cheap these days, but they&#39;re also really easy to find at garage sales, fleamarkets, and swapmeets. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-6-Outlet-Protector-2-Pack-2-Foot/dp/B014EKQ5AA/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=power+strip&amp;amp;qid=1575221486&amp;amp;sr=8-4&#34;&gt;Amazon Basics 6-plug power strips&lt;/a&gt; used to be dirt-cheap, like $3 for a two-pack, but as of this writing they&#39;re now $10 for two... a bummer, those used to be a real steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;If you&#39;re ever in doubt about the functionality of an AC outlet, or if you&#39;re going to be taking your work to a place where AC wiring may be questionable, a&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2Ldtglr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; cheap outlet tester&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is useful - it will confirm the presence of AC voltage, whether the hot/neutral are reversed, and other incorrect-wiring hazards. If you just need to confirm whether an AC circuit is hot, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35UMWm6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non-contact voltage detector pen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the easiest tool to use - just hold the on-button and place the non-conducting tip near the (potential) AC voltage. If it beeps and lights up, there&#39;s some AC present. Be warned though - the presence of AC-something is not a guarentee of 120 volts or 15 amps or whatever you actually need, just that there&#39;s some fluctuating voltage nearby. Just last week I watched an electrician get mislead by his NCV on a three-phase system - his pen told him all 3 phases had AC, but when he got around to actually sticking his meter probes in the test points, one of the phases was only &#34;33V&#34; to ground (i.e. the system had dropped a phase). You&#39;ve been warned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Power Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;While I don&#39;t often use a &lt;strong&gt;power drill&lt;/strong&gt; for actual workbench projects, the ability to stick a screw in a wall or quickly knock a hole in something is nice. I received a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/384LNdw&#34;&gt;cordless Black and Decker 20V drill&lt;/a&gt; as a gift years ago, and its been sufficient for my home purposes ever since. Sure, at the point in my career where I was putting 3/8&#34; lag bolts into 2&#34; of plywood, the building had standardized on &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35LJU3g&#34;&gt;Ryobi impact drivers&lt;/a&gt;, which are much stout-er. But the&#39;re also more expensive, and for home-use, I just don&#39;t usually need that much firepower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;My old accomplice turned my on to the virtues of an &lt;strong&gt;electric screwdriver&lt;/strong&gt;. Why would you need an electric screwdriver when you have a high-torque, high speed, large battery drill? Exactly because the electric screwdriver is lightweight, low-speed, and easy to transport - you&#39;re not using it to drive screw into material, you&#39;re using it to take machine screws out of an electrical panel, say. Or install a hundred rack-mount screws. Or take out and reinstall a Euro-rack module 60 times. The light weight and ease-of-use of the screwdriver limits fatigue over long projects like these. &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/34QiAAI&#34;&gt;Black and Decker&lt;/a&gt; makes a fine, inexpensive model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;We&#39;ll get into the virtues of heat shrink tubing some later day when we dive into materials, but an inexpensive &lt;strong&gt;heat gun&lt;/strong&gt; is the appropriate tool for using it. I started with a $10 model from Harbor Frieght which lasted 5 years, and then bought another $10 to replace it. The trouble with all heat guns under $100, it seems, is ergonomics. After you&#39;ve used the gun for a couple minutes and brought the metal tip to a searing-hot temperature, what do you do with it? This &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2L9m2yU&#34;&gt;Porter-Cable model&lt;/a&gt;, with a flat-but you can stand up on your workbench, is the best solution I&#39;ve seen. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OBWEnm&#34;&gt;Professional models&lt;/a&gt; have a flat or angled plate on the back to stand up in just this way.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Hand Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;A few basic hand tools will go a long way in making your workbench serviceable and ready to tackle common challenges - some are worth a little investment, while others are prime fodder for the cheapo &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.harborfreight.com/&#34;&gt;Harbor Freight&lt;/a&gt; model. And thankfully, there are a number of tools where jumping from the $5 version to the $10 version makes a world of difference, and is worth the Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;There are lots of different tools to strip insulation off of wire - manual strippers, semi-automated strippers, fully automated stripers, a par of cutting pliers, a knife, your teeth... not that I would recommend all of those. But you can&#39;t really go wrong with a basic set of &lt;strong&gt;wire strippers&lt;/strong&gt; that covers gauges from 10 to 30 AWG. These &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35PRzO1&#34;&gt;Paladin wire strippers&lt;/a&gt; were our go to at my last job, and they fit the bill just fine. The curved handle takes a little getting used to, but it actually makes them pretty ergonomic, which is nice if you&#39;re splicing a couple hundred bits of wire to LEDs in an afternoon, say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;A decent set of &lt;strong&gt;flush cutters&lt;/strong&gt; is also worth a minor investment - not more than $7-8 a pair, mind, just don&#39;t get the $3 ones or they&#39;ll fall apart. Flush cutters are the tool of choice for trimming the leads on components, say, but they&#39;re also great for getting a clean end-cut on a piece of wire, or trimming flashing off of 3D-printed models. On the advice of my accomplice at my old job, we&#39;d order &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/34BH3Kg&#34;&gt;5-packs of Hakko-brand flush cutters&lt;/a&gt; regularly, and they served us well. For less critical cuts, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/37T349j&#34;&gt;a couple pairs of scissors&lt;/a&gt; is handy, though for papercraft I prefer &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2qTnEG9&#34;&gt;single-edge razor blades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small pliers&lt;/strong&gt; are something you can go the inexpensive route on - Harbor Freight or eBay ones would be fine, you&#39;re usually not going to be putting so much force on them that you&#39;re in danger of damaging them. This set of &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2rGDvHY&#34;&gt;6 assorted pliers for $20&lt;/a&gt; I ordered for my new workbench has been pretty solid - the extra long, extra thin needle-nose pliers I keep near my 3D printer for pulling ooze off the nozzle right before a print. Having a few &lt;strong&gt;heavier duty pliers&lt;/strong&gt; around is often helpful - just a basic &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OVtkqM&#34;&gt;lineman&#39;s pliers&lt;/a&gt; for when you need to put some force into the work would be a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Long nose pleirs&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-693 post-img&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; src=&#34;DSC00065-300x169.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;One of my favorite pairs of pliers - long thin nose, good grip, and $2 at the hardware store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I must confess - I don&#39;t find the sets of &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2qTHalR&#34;&gt;one small screwdriver handle and 1700 bits&lt;/a&gt;&#34; to be terribly practical. They&#39;re great to have around for special projects, but the extra time spent swapping bits back and forth for every project/object/screw is  wearisome. As daily driver&lt;strong&gt; small screwdrivers&lt;/strong&gt;, I much prefer a set of basic jewelers screwdrivers in philips, flat, and hex. This &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/33BHZgf&#34;&gt;Wera 12-piece&lt;/a&gt; set is my go-to recommendation these days, and the carrying-case is nice if you don&#39;t have permanent storage set up yet or if you&#39;re throwing your screwdrivers in a toolbag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Wera Screwdrivers&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-694 post-img&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;IMG_8950-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;Decent screwdrivers that don&#39;t strip themselves instantly, in a nice carrying case too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;A basic &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2q84g7G&#34;&gt;6-in-1 screwdriver&lt;/a&gt; suffices for most &lt;strong&gt;large screwdriver&lt;/strong&gt; needs. That link is the cheapest one I could find on Amazon, but honestly, they&#39;re often between $1 and $3 at any hardware store, grab a couple then next time you see one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;It&#39;s amazing how cheap &lt;strong&gt;digital calipers&lt;/strong&gt; have become - less than $20 for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2szYVae&#34;&gt;decent 6&#34; caliper&lt;/a&gt; that does decimal inches, fractional inches, and millimeters. The calipers are among the top-five most commonly used tools on my bench, along with the soldering iron, pliers, and screwdrivers. You can measure interior dimensions, exterior dimensions, depth, diameter, all with a precision unmatched by analog means. Get yourself a set, it will change your bench. For larger measurements, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2P1jL9R&#34;&gt;basic &lt;strong&gt;tape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2P1jL9R&#34;&gt; measure&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is handy - no need to get a fancy one unless your carpenter-ing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Digital Calipers&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-695 post-img&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; src=&#34;DSC00067-300x169.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
20 years ago, these would have been a multi-hundred dollar item. Now they&#39;re basically disposable.
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Adhesives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I wish I had a more in-depth knowledges of adhesives, epoxies, and glues. The properties department at the theater I used to work at maintained an encyclopedic knowledge of which glues were best of which applications, which chemicals were safe for which materials, which drying-times would lead to problems with material interactions... it was stunning. For my general purposes though, there a few basic adhesives that get me through the day more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Glue&lt;/strong&gt; is a tremendously versatile material - you can stick most (rough) surfaces together with it, you can build up gussets and supports with it, you mold it to shape a little, and it removes easily from most things except paper. And did you know &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OFzInj&#34;&gt;it comes in black&lt;/a&gt;? A &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2Dw73uD&#34;&gt;decent 100W hot-glue gun&lt;/a&gt; is a great &#34;well this just has to hold a little while&#34; solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;For more permanent fixes, &lt;strong&gt;cyanoacrylate glue &lt;/strong&gt;(also known as CA glue or the brand names &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/33Hf7Db&#34;&gt;Super Glue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or &lt;strong&gt;Crazy Glue&lt;/strong&gt;) is a good go-to - it bonds to most things with a slightly-rough surface (so roughing up, say, metal with a file first is a good idea). It hardens in the presence of moisture - atmospheric humidity is enough, but if you put a big glob on something, the outside layer will start to set first and slow the setting process of the inside. Use only a thin layer to reduce this issue - in the right circumstances, the glue will set in a matter of seconds. If you need a little bit more working time or pliability, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2Y69opn&#34;&gt;E6000 Adhesive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a better choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Very High Bond &lt;strong&gt;double-sided tape&lt;/strong&gt; (VHB) is an amazing product (well, line of products) from 3M. They give you the versatility of double-stick tape with some crazy adhesive capabilities. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/vhb-tapes-us/&#34;&gt;3M&#39;s full catalog of adhesive tapes&lt;/a&gt; is worth browsing if you&#39;re into that sort of thing. As a good default, their &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2Lr96EL&#34;&gt;RP62 foam-tape&lt;/a&gt; is strong, slightly spongy (good for bridging irregular surfaces), and relatively inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;For adhering large sheets of goods together, especially paper products, some kind of &lt;strong&gt;spray adhesive &lt;/strong&gt;is going to be easier to use than a brush-on or dab-on variety. &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2OGOqut&#34;&gt;3M&#39;s Super 77&lt;/a&gt; is the de-facto standard spray adhesive for light- and medium-duty applications - adhering paper to paper for scrapbooking, or laminates to sheet goods. Simply spray Super 77 onto one of the surfaces, wait 60-90 seconds for the adhesive to become slightly tacky, then smoothly lay the second material onto the first. For heavier applications, there&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2L9STDw&#34;&gt;High Strength 90 spray adhesive&lt;/a&gt; that works much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thistothat.com/&#34;&gt;thistothat.com&lt;/a&gt;, a website that generates recommendations if you want to glue &lt;em&gt;this material&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to &lt;em&gt;that material&lt;/em&gt;. Want to stick ceramic to rubber? They&#39;ve got a solution to that, and lots of other combinations as well. Well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;3D Printing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I know I said I wouldn&#39;t get too far into specific materials or specific arenas of work, but having a 3D printer in your electronics workshop opens up a whole world of mechanical possibilities. Whether its &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/2018/08/28/50w-qrp-amplifier-3d-printed-case-design-and-livestream/&#34;&gt;custom enclosures for new projects&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/2019/03/09/3d-printing-in-the-home-workshop/&#34;&gt;quality of life improvements&lt;/a&gt; for the shop or project mockups or practical tools, the sky&#39;s the limit of what you can accomplish. Getting started in 3D printing could be a whole series of articles in and of itself, but for the moment let me confine myself to some recommendations of tools to facilitate the practical use of 3D printing on an electronics workbench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter wp-image-351 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;PSU_1-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;To start, the printer itself. I don&#39;t have any experience with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a2xNaAkvLo&#34;&gt;SLA 3D printing&lt;/a&gt;, only the more traditional &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRhZTdafE4&#34;&gt;FDM method&lt;/a&gt;. An FDM 3D printer is essentially a fancy robotic hot-glue gun on rails, that moves precisely around a 3D space squirting out hot plastic as it goes, which sets into shape as it rapidly cools down. This is a relatively speedy way of printing an object, but the spatial resolution of the resulting object is limited by the resolution of both the stepper motors that push the print-nozzing around and the diameter of the print nozzle. Still, with a stock 0.4mm nozzle and a basic machine, some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dss1yUHH-QY&#34;&gt;really beautiful things&lt;/a&gt; are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Wall Thermostat Tag&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-704 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; src=&#34;DSC00071-small-300x169.png&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;How do YOU control your hot-end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;If I were to recommend a first FDM 3D printer to someone today, it would be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-mini/&#34;&gt;Original Prusa MINI&lt;/a&gt;. Josef Prusa was one of the original movers and shakers when the hobbyist 3D printer train was getting rolling in early 2010s, and his i3 model is perhaps the most popular 3D printer in the world. With a reputation for a great product and great customer service, the release of a printer at that key $350 price point that&#39;s become so popular, with mesh bed leveling, a heated bed with removable build-sheets, ethernet connectivity with WiFi upgrade possibilities, an option filament run-out sensor... I&#39;m very excited for this thing. It&#39;s currently on pre-order for $350 US to start shipping around the end of the year, and I think it&#39;s going to be a slam dunk. When I think that i paid about that much for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=13860&#34;&gt;Monoprice Maker Select V2.1&lt;/a&gt; only 3 years ago, it&#39;s amazing to think how far the technology has come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;3D Printer&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-705 post-img&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; src=&#34;DSC00072-300x169.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;This printer took a few mods to make the frame rock-solid. Amazing what 3 years progress looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Of course, all of the specific nozzles, filaments, and accessories you need will be specific to your printer and your projects. But I can recommend a couple of tools that will be useful to all FDM 3D-printing setups, the first being a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2DLYOuF&#34;&gt;set of 3D printing spatulas.&lt;/a&gt; Most printers ship with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/33Cfxeh&#34;&gt;putty knife&lt;/a&gt; as their print-removal-tool, which is an excellent way to gouge a hole in your print surface (or your hand!). Since receiving a set of these spatulas as a present for Christmas last year, they&#39;ve easily become the tool I keep closest to the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;3D Printing Spatulas&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-706 post-img&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;DSC00073-169x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;169&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;These were definitely sitting on a shelf somewhere as palette knives and someone thought &#34;you know what we could sell those as? 3D printing spatulas!&#34; But they work, so who cares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Second, while there are lots of methods of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaF28dnDgKA&#34;&gt;getting your 3D print to stick to the print bed&lt;/a&gt;, keeping the bed itself clean of oils and debris goes a long way toward success. I keep a bottle of &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2rFOu4y&#34;&gt;high-strength isopropyl alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and some lint-free clothes nearby to wipe down the bed between every few prints, just to make sure the residual oils from printing and from my hands don&#39;t cause premature liftoff from the print bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Software&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;In this digital age, MS Paint is just as practical a tool as a paintbrush. So let&#39;s not leave out the digital tools that we use to make, track, distribute, and record projects on the workbench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;2D drafting&lt;/strong&gt;, my two primary tools are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview&#34;&gt;AutoCAD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US&#34;&gt;Vectorworks&lt;/a&gt;. AutoCAD (made by AutoDesk) is an incredibly powerful CAD program, and it&#39;s been around forever. Want to model a bracket, or a whole airplane, or design a building, or pocket watch? AutoCAD can do it. It does have a fairly-steep learning curve - there are folks who make entire careers out of just working in AutoCAD - but it gives you a lot of power for your trouble. Vectorworks is a less-commonly-used program that I became very familiar with in my years as a stage lighting technician; due to its excellent stage-lighting plugins, it&#39;s the de-facto standard for theater lighting. And where AutoCAD focuses on building a &#34;model&#34; and having you derive drawings from that model, Vectorworks focuses on the drawing itself as &lt;em&gt;the thing to be made&lt;/em&gt;. It might seem like a semantic difference, but the way that those philosophies influence the workflow of the two programs means that Vectorworks is often my choice for creating 2D draftings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;3D drafting&lt;/strong&gt;, my go-to software is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview-b&#34;&gt;Fusion360&lt;/a&gt;, also from AutoDesk. Fusion is a timeline-centric, parametric drafting program, which allows you to go &#39;back in time&#39; to an earlier moment of a design, make changes, and see them ripple through to the current version of the design. It&#39;s a very powerful program, though not without its own learning curve. For someone just diving into 3D modeling for the first time, I&#39;d recommend starting with something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tinkercad.com/&#34;&gt;Tinkercad,&lt;/a&gt; a cloud-based modelling program that centers around adding and subtracting primitive objects from each other to build up a more complicated design. I&#39;ve also had friends work in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sketchup.com/&#34;&gt;SketchUp&lt;/a&gt;, which tries to blend Fusion&#39;s 2D sketch capabilities with the ease of Tinkercad. Unfortunately, SketchUp seems to have trouble successfully exporting STL files for printing, so I can&#39;t recommend it as a strong starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Fusion 360 Screenshot&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-717 post-img&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;FusionCapture2-265x300.png&#34; width=&#34;265&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;Fusion is a very powerful, very worth-learning program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Once you have your 3D model and you&#39;re ready to print it, you&#39;ll need a &lt;strong&gt;slicer program&lt;/strong&gt; to turn the model into a series of step-by-step instructions that the printer can actually follow. (&#34;&lt;em&gt;Move to such-and-such coordinates in so-many seconds while extruding this-amount of plastic&lt;/em&gt;&#34;. Repeat x10000). I personally use &lt;a href=&#34;https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura&#34;&gt;Cura&lt;/a&gt;, now from Ultimaker. It&#39;s straightforward to use, and has all the options and customizability I&#39;ve found a need for. I know lots of folks who have good opinions about the open source &lt;a href=&#34;https://slic3r.org/&#34;&gt;Slic3r project&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming and text editing &lt;/strong&gt;may or may not be a part of your electronics hobby, but if they are, having simple straightforward tools is a good way to get more productivity out of your text-based time. Of course for programming Arduinos, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software&#34;&gt;Arduino IDE&lt;/a&gt; is a perfectly good place to start. It&#39;s not fully featured in an respect, but it just works, you can write code in it and plonk it on an Arduino, and that&#39;s all most people care about. I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sublimetext.com/&#34;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; as my main text editor and sometimes basic dev environment (when writing things in &lt;a href=&#34;https://love2d.org/&#34;&gt;Love2D&lt;/a&gt;, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;For projects that are just too detailed to lay out by hand, I &lt;strong&gt;design circuit boards&lt;/strong&gt; in AutoDesk&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview&#34;&gt;Eagle&lt;/a&gt; software, though there are some who would say I&#39;m a heathen for not using the open source &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kicad-pcb.org/&#34;&gt;KiCad&lt;/a&gt;. To be honest, I don&#39;t have strong feelings about either software either way - Eagle was just the first one I used and I&#39;ve become used to its workflow and design choices, but I know there are die-hards on both sides of this river. Regardless, to live in an age where a maker has multiple, quality options for free PCB design software is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;DMX Circuit Board&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-383 post-img&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; src=&#34;V03-Board-300x285.png&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-img-caption&#34;&gt;I would never in a million years be able to achieve this level of miniaturization with a hand-fabricated board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Of course, once you&#39;ve designed a circuit board, you&#39;re going to need to make it, somehow. While they&#39;re not software per-say, the growth of &lt;strong&gt;PCB shopping cart&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;websites&lt;/strong&gt; over the past few years has really opened up what&#39;s possible for the solo electronics workshop. No more sweating with getting tiny wires soldered to tiny chips to break them out to veroboard; you can just spin a PCB with the proper footprint, or indeed the whole circuit. Any of these services will let you upload your circuit board design, and for a very modest fee spin you up 3 or 5 or 500 copies. &lt;a href=&#34;https://oshpark.com/&#34;&gt;OSHPark&lt;/a&gt; really started the whole small-batch-PCB movement, and their service has always been great, reliable, and high quality. I&#39;ve also used &lt;a href=&#34;https://jlcpcb.com/&#34;&gt;JLCPCB&lt;/a&gt; for somewhat larger runs. If you&#39;re interested in looking at many, many options, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pcbshopper.com/&#34;&gt;PCBShopper&lt;/a&gt; is an aggregator that lets you compare prices, lead times, and options across almost two dozen shopping cart-style manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Just because you may not have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwzwzobO5rs&#34;&gt;giant 5-axis robot in your workshop&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t take safety seriously. Whether your workshop is in your home, an outside shop, or your workplace, a few basic safety precautions could mean the difference between peaceful Thursday and a trip to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors &lt;/strong&gt;should be present in several places in your home or office already, but having one in the workshop is a good idea, especially if you have any hot-tools (soldering iron, heat gun, 3D printer). They&#39;re so &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2RfwNDH&#34;&gt;inexpensive and easy to install&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s a no-brainer to pick one up. A &lt;strong&gt;fire extinguisher&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;should also be on your list - and if you ever have the opportunity to get a little training on how to properly use one, it&#39;s well worth it. Make sure to mount your &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2La7TkI&#34;&gt;fire extinguisher&lt;/a&gt; where you could actually get to it, if the things that are most likely to start a fire, did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Fire extinguisher&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-707 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;DSC00074-169x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;169&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I put my fire extinguisher right by the door to my workshop, so I can grab it on the way in, or on the way out.
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;While we&#39;re thinking about fire, consider whether your workshop needs a &lt;strong&gt;flammables cabinet&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&#39;re storing more than a few things of paint, spray paint, spray adhesives, solvents, cleaners, etc, it&#39;s worth thinking about what would happen if they were to catch a little on fire. It&#39;s not usually worth buying on online - the shipping is killer- but cabinets pop up on Craigslist, auctions, and industrial surplus all the time. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.go-dove.com/&#34;&gt;Go Industry Dove Bid&lt;/a&gt; is a good online collector of industrial surplus auctions, but be sure to check out your local city/state surplus resources as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;safety glasses&lt;/strong&gt;. Just wear them, even when you think you don&#39;t have to. About 4 years ago, while soldering &#34;just one more joint&#34; on a PCB before going to bed, a piece of hot solder popped up and got me in the lower-left eyelid. A quarter-inch higher and it would have been right in my eye, with who knows what consequences. I&#39;m not always perfect about this myself, but I do keep a pair of safety glasses right on my workbench to remind myself that if I want to take a risk, it&#39;s my own damn fault. Get &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2LbC37b&#34;&gt;a pair of glasses that are comfortable&lt;/a&gt; so you&#39;re more likely to wear them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Organization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Resistor Bins&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-711 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;Resistors-1-225x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;225&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
No such thing as too organized.
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve come to realize something over the past 10 years - the most volume I&#39;m willing to rummage through for a tool, part, or piece is about 500 cubic inches, or a around 10 liters. Any more volume than that, especially for small parts, and there&#39;s just too many potential places where a small object can hide. So standardizing on a &lt;strong&gt;storage bin&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s slightly smaller than this makes good sense. At home, I use&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.menards.com/main/storage-organization/storage-totes-bins/storage-totes/bella-storage-solution-6-quart-clear-storage-bin/belmn0105011012/p-1444430572277-c-12667.htm?tid=5967592820392133336&amp;amp;ipos=2&#34;&gt; 6-Quart Bella bins&lt;/a&gt; from Menards, while at work I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2YdeLDu&#34;&gt;6-Quart Sterilite bins&lt;/a&gt;. Once a project or set of components or tools overflows one of these bins, there&#39;s probably enough diversity in goods to split it up into two separate bins anyway - i just recently split the &lt;em&gt;Microcontrollers&lt;/em&gt; bin into &lt;em&gt;Arduinos &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Non-Arduino Microcontrollers&lt;/em&gt;, for example. Now both species are easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Storage Bins&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-708 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; src=&#34;DSC00077-300x169.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
So many pretty bins, all in a row.
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve always loved a good &lt;strong&gt;whiteboard&lt;/strong&gt; (I just snagged &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2Y3JoLk&#34;&gt;another 18&#34;x24&#34;&lt;/a&gt; one for my office), but I recently stumbled upon these &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2Y4xoJC&#34;&gt;ultra-fine tip whiteboard markers&lt;/a&gt;, which I just absolutely love. They allow you to squeeze so much actual detail and small size into a whiteboard doodling project. Not for presenting to a group, mind, just for working through projects on your own or with a partner. (I also 3D printed a cup for them for my kitchen whiteboard calendar, more on that in a future post I think.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Wall Pen Cup&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter wp-image-710 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;DSC00078-169x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;169&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I&#39;m a strong believer in the power of labeling to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiSn2JuDQSc&#34;&gt;make things just so,&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;labelmaker&lt;/strong&gt; is a really easy way to help keep things organized. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35TwTEZ&#34;&gt;Brother PTD600&lt;/a&gt; has been a nice blend between portability and computer control - you get most of the functionality just using it handheld, or you can hook it up to Brother&#39;s software on your computer to make more complicated layouts, batch prints, etc. The sound department at the theater I used to work at had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/37WFbxN&#34;&gt;Rhino BMP21-Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which was really awesome at making &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2qaic17&#34;&gt;self-laminating labels&lt;/a&gt; to label cables - with the amount of work that went into cable arrangement and maintenance in that place, the self-laminating labels were a godsend. The tape&#39;s a little pricey, as is the labeller, so if you&#39;re not doing a lot of patch panels, say, I would stick with the Brother and the TZe line of tapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Lighting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Decent task lighting makes a world of difference - you&#39;ll find you&#39;re suddenly better at soldering, more deft at assembly, swifter to catch errors and notice mistakes. No sense working in the dark if you don&#39;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve done a number of lighting setups in my home workshops over time. Right now I have three &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2P0nUel&#34;&gt;24&#34; fluorescent fixture&lt;/a&gt;s overhead that were remaindered from a theatre production ages ago (in addition to a basic 100W ceiling light). I&#39;ve also got a couple of &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2P1At9l&#34;&gt;clip lights&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2LcrVeK&#34;&gt;100W LED bulbs&lt;/a&gt; closer to my actual workbench surface to price more focused task lighting, and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/33FODSy&#34;&gt;cheap gooseneck light from IKEA&lt;/a&gt; sitting on the work surface for when I need really targeted illumination. While I haven&#39;t re-installed it since I moved into a new home workshop a few months ago, adding under-shelf lights to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeff.glass/2019/03/03/home-office-overhaul/&#34;&gt;home shelving setup&lt;/a&gt; made a big difference in being able to see and find components on the shelves, as well as adding some cheery glow to the workstation. My workshop at work has lots of overhead fluorescent light, and I added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2R9XyZS&#34;&gt;positionable jointed lamp&lt;/a&gt; for some more focused lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Your Own Shop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;If you&#39;re still reading this 6500 words later, you might thinking - &#34;&lt;em&gt;Holy crap, that&#39;s a lot of stuff, I&#39;ll never be able to have my own electronics workbench&#34;&lt;/em&gt;. But keep in mind - this is the setup and tools that work for me, with what I want to do, that I&#39;ve built up over a decade of working professionally and as a hobbyist in this arena. Would you look at a professional auto mechanic rebuilding an engine and say &#34;Wow, I&#39;ll never open my hood again?&#34; It&#39;s all a matter of starting somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Workbench&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-712 size-medium post-img&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;FirstWorkbench-1-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-image-caption&#34;&gt;Two apartments and many years ago, this is what my &#34;workbench&#34; looked like. And it was still a BLAST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The easiest way to pick a project is to &lt;strong&gt;find a project you want to accomplish and work toward making it happen&lt;/strong&gt;. Maybe it&#39;s monitoring to see whether your garage door is open or closed. Or what the weather&#39;s going to be tomorrow. Maybe your dog needs some entertainment, or you need a new sparkling light over the crib, or the you have an itch to build a radio or a tesla coil or who knows what. Once you find a thing you&#39;re excited about building, that will guide you as to which tools to find first, which will lead you to more things you can do with those tools, which will lead to more tools... and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;And most importantly - have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;post-h3&#34;&gt;Special Thanks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I wouldn&#39;t have been aware of so many of these tools, ideas, and possibilities without a lot of excellent colleagues and friends. Thank you especially to Kenneth, Palmer, Alec, Joe, Mike, Jabin, Lee, Travis, Chris, and all the other excellent technicians who continue to be an inspiration for excellent technical work.&lt;/p&gt;
