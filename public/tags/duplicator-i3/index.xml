      <description>I&#39;ve had a clear, &#34;low poly&#34; angular sculpture in clear PLA sitting on my self for awhile now. Earlier this week, I turned it into a lamp shade.
I built the original model in Blender along the lines of this video from Maker&#39;s Muse. The gist of the process is:
Start with a basic solid, like a sphere or a cube.Decimate the solid (reduce the number of triangles that make up the shape) to a very very low level, perhaps down to 20 or 30 polygons.</description>
