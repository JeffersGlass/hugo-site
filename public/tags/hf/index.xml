      <description>The 5W-to-50W QRP HF Amplifier project is rolling along nicelyÂ - I received the first PCB draft in the male this week and am 90% of the way through assembling it, with only heatsink-placement left to sort out.
I&#39;ve made a couple of additions to the schematic since the original layout, including a relay-activated indicator (R27 and its LED) and an RF-output sensing LED (from C14 to its associated LED to ground) along the the lines of VK3YE&#39;s recent project.</description>
