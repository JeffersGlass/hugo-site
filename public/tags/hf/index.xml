      <description>The 5W-to-50W QRP HF Amplifier project is rolling along nicely - I received the first PCB draft in the male this week and am 90% of the way through assembling it, with only heatsink-placement left to sort out.
I&#39;ve made a couple of additions to the schematic since the original layout, including a relay-activated indicator (R27 and its LED) and an RF-output sensing LED (from C14 to its associated LED to ground) along the the lines of VK3YE&#39;s recent project.</description>

      <title>50W QRP Amplifier – PCB Layout Video</title>

      <description>This past weekend, I started on the process of laying out the 50W QRP Amplifier project as a PCB. Small PCBs can be remarkably inexpensive these days - $10-$15 for 5 pieces of say 4&#34;x4&#34;, shipped in 2-3 weeks. I&#39;m treating this amplifier project as a chance to experiment with different, similar FETs to learn about critical power MOSFET properties, and also as an opportunity to brush up my layout skills that I haven&#39;t used in awhile.</description>

      <title>50W QRP Amplifier - First Demonstration</title>

      <description>This post is cross-posted to my ham-radio specific blog, kk9jef.wordpress.com.
As I alluded to last week, I&#39;ve been working on a simple &#34;QRP Amplifier&#34; to kick my power up from 5W to something a little more punchy. Specifically, an amp I can still use when portable. There&#39;s something wonderful about achieving a contact with only 5W, but there&#39;s also the frustration of getting into the field and having band conditions just wreck your day.</description>
