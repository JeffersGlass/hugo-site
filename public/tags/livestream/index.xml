      <description>In BC times (Before Covid), I had often dreamed of setting up a semi-regular gathering with some nerd friends to make things. We&#39;d all sit around, drink beer, eat trail mix, and bash things together with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis and servos and LEDs and what have you.

      <description>This Sunday evening, March 22nd 2020 at 7pm Central time, I&#39;ll be hosting a livestreaming Introduction to Arduino over on YouTube!
We&#39;ll start from scratch installing the Arduino IDE software, then moving on to programming fundamentals, wiring to the Arduino and using a breadboard, and more. We should cover enough ground to be useful to absolute beginners and pro&#39;s alike.
Grab a cold one and come join me live as we make stuff and learn things.</description>
