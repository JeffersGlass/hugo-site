      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve had a clear, &#34;low poly&#34; angular sculpture in clear PLA sitting on my self for awhile now. Earlier this week, I turned it into a lamp shade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;I built the original model in Blender along the lines of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IwJDfT-H6o&#34;&gt;this video from Maker&#39;s Muse&lt;/a&gt;. The gist of the process is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;post-ul&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with a basic solid, like a sphere or a cube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decimate the solid (reduce the number of triangles that make up the shape) to a very very low level, perhaps down to 20 or 30 polygons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stretch and place the vertices of this blocky solid until satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;In this case, I had ideas about turning this shape into a lighting table topper, with an Arduino and LEDs underneath the open base. But other projects popped up, and this open-base blocky pyramid has sat dormant for several months. This week, I finally found a use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;In my living room, I have a tall two-socket light fixture standing in the corner. One socket stands at the top of the lamp, with a broad frosted dish shade, and there&#39;s a small flexible arm coming off the side of the lamp which lost its shade long ago. My partner and I both enjoy using this flexible arm as a re-positionable reading lamp, but that lack of a shade means it&#39;s been pretty glare-y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;By trimming the top off of the clear pyramid, I converted the Agrocrag into a lampshade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-85 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;327&#34; src=&#34;IMG_43691-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;436&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;The shade is trapped in place by the bulb itself. Of course, an LED bulb is a must, since the heat of an incandescent (or even CFL) light bulb will melt or deform the shade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;wp-image-84 aligncenter post-img&#34; height=&#34;401&#34; src=&#34;IMG_43711-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;534&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;post-p&#34;&gt;Just a little project-reuse for the home!&lt;/p&gt;
