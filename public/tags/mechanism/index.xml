      <description>This weekend I&#39;ve added the pinion gears to the seven-segment display, and performed the first test rotation of the mechanism.
As previous noted, the arm gears are 6-tooth gears of module 4 (metric) - in clockmaking terms, these would be pinions. In the clockmaking world, where I&#39;ve been doing quite a bit of research during this project, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a hard dividing line between what&#39;s considered a &#34;</description>

      <title>Geared 7-Segment Display, Part 3 - Drive Gear Interlocks</title>

      <description>The heart of the seven segment display is the seven drive gears with select teeth, which share a common shaft and all rotate together. As I was developing the idea of the drive gears and conceiving of how the presence/lack of teeth could &#34;signal&#34; the arm gears to turn or not, I though of them as plain, 2-dimensional shapes. I had planned on spacing them out along their common shaft using 3D printed washers of a set thickness.</description>

      <title>Geared 7-Segment Display - Part 2, More Gears</title>

      <description>While time at home is scarce this week, I&#39;ve stolen a couple moments late night to continue working on the design of the geared 7-segment display, including finishing the modelling of the 7 drive gears.
Each drive gear is based on a 30-tooth, involute gear of module 4. Each segment of 3 adjacent teeth represents a single transition of a segment (or lack there of) - if there are teeth in a segment, the associated arm gear will rotate, changing a segment from active to inactive for a given transition or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Geared 7-Segment Display - Part 1</title>

      <description>Over the weekend, I got started on a project I’ve been musing about for a few months – making a mechanical 7-segment display, using gears to move individual segments in and out of the display area via rotation of a central shaft or belt.
The inspiration for this idea is undoubtedly Arthur Ganson’s mechanical sculpture Gary’s Yellow Chair at the MIT Museum in Cambridge, video of which periodically makes the rounds on Reddit.</description>
