      <description>.js&#34;--Code for all days is on GitHub
Day 2Nothing terribly fancy going on with the day 2 challenge - essentially, reading in a text file and doing operations on strings. After developing the ability to split the input lines and validate them in part one, part 2 throws a curveball by changing up how the lines should be validated. I refactored my &#34;isValidLine&#34; code to take a validation function as one of its arguments, since the parsing/splitting of the line is the same for both parts 1 and 2.</description>

      <description>I know in my introductory post I said I wasn&#39;t going to post something every day, and I meant it! But I ended up with a little extra time on my hands today and this casual summary has turned into an actual post... I&#39;m going to have to think about how I categorize these posts so anyone who stumbled across my blog isn&#39;t wading through five pages of Advent of Code writeups before getting to tiny moving lights.</description>

      <description>Last winter, I participated in the annual Advent of Code Challenge, a website which offers small (but not necessarily easy) programming challenges every day from December 1 through 25. It turned out to be a great way to get exposed to different corners of development in my language of choice (Python), and with a little more time on my hands this Winter, I&#39;m excited to dive into it again.
The challenges are all written in a non-programming-language-specific way.</description>
