      <description>Over the past 12 months or so, I&#39;ve dipped my toes into some basic cheesemaking, including cream cheese, farmer&#39;s cheese, and ricotta. But for me, there&#39;s no better cheese than a sharp white cheddar, and with an eye toward making cheddar and some other hard cheeses, I&#39;ve built my own cheese press and my own first hard cheese.
The process I used to construct the press is very similar to this instructable.</description>
