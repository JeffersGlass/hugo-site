      <title>Closet Door Locker</title>

      <description>Yesterday I install a new closet door in our front entrance hall, and discovered a problem which I then solved with 3D Printing. The door is a standard bi-fold type, with pins in the top and bottom of one side for rotation, a central vertical hinge, and a track along the top to keep the far side in alignment.
The problem was - with the volume of coats we need to survive a the winter on the ice planet Hoth (Chicago) and the positioning of the hanger rail, the coats push the door out and prevent it from staying fulling closed.</description>

      <title>50W QRP Amplifier - 3D Printed Case Design and Livestream</title>

      <description>With the 50W QRP amplifier project coming along nicely, I felt it was time to start thinking about a reproducible case for the project. And for custom, reproducible cases, 3D printing is my current tool of choice.
I ended up designing the case on a YouTube Livestream on Saturday night, to which a few great colleagues stopped by to ask questions and offer advice. The full video is below.</description>

      <title>Geared 7-Segment Display, Part 4 - Pinion Gears and First Rotation</title>

      <description>This weekend I&#39;ve added the pinion gears to the seven-segment display, and performed the first test rotation of the mechanism.
As previous noted, the arm gears are 6-tooth gears of module 4 (metric) - in clockmaking terms, these would be pinions. In the clockmaking world, where I&#39;ve been doing quite a bit of research during this project, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a hard dividing line between what&#39;s considered a &#34;</description>

      <title>Geared 7-Segment Display, Part 3 - Drive Gear Interlocks</title>

      <description>The heart of the seven segment display is the seven drive gears with select teeth, which share a common shaft and all rotate together. As I was developing the idea of the drive gears and conceiving of how the presence/lack of teeth could &#34;signal&#34; the arm gears to turn or not, I though of them as plain, 2-dimensional shapes. I had planned on spacing them out along their common shaft using 3D printed washers of a set thickness.</description>

      <title>Geared 7-Segment Display - Part 1</title>

      <description>Over the weekend, I got started on a project I’ve been musing about for a few months – making a mechanical 7-segment display, using gears to move individual segments in and out of the display area via rotation of a central shaft or belt.
The inspiration for this idea is undoubtedly Arthur Ganson’s mechanical sculpture Gary’s Yellow Chair at the MIT Museum in Cambridge, video of which periodically makes the rounds on Reddit.</description>
