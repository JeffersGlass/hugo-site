      <title>First Parks on the Air Activation - K-4160, Volo Bog</title>

      <description>I mentioned in my Field Day post from a few weeks ago that I was hoping to get out to a Parks on the Air activation soon, and this past Saturday, I made it happen!
Parks on the Air is an international program inspired by the ARRL&#39;s 2016 National Parks on the Air event. While that program ended at the beginning of 2017, a group of invested amateurs set about booting up an independent, ongoing program in the style of Summits on the Air, Islands on the Air, World Wide Flora and Fauna, etc.</description>

Despite sunburns, shattered plastic, and a literal tornado warning, sunburns, I had a great time at Field Day 2021 this year.
My intention had been to head out to the northern Chicago suburbs on Saturday morning for some testing of the setup. My wife and I had purchased an annual pass to the Lake County dog parks in anticipation of the Fourth of July weekend, and our plan had been to drop her (and Winnifred, a very good dog) at one of these parks, go around the corner to a quieter, non-dog-filled local park, setup and operate for an hour and change, then pick the two of them up and head home.</description>

      <title>50W QRP Amplifier - 3D Printed Case Design and Livestream</title>

      <description>With the 50W QRP amplifier project coming along nicely, I felt it was time to start thinking about a reproducible case for the project. And for custom, reproducible cases, 3D printing is my current tool of choice.
I ended up designing the case on a YouTube Livestream on Saturday night, to which a few great colleagues stopped by to ask questions and offer advice. The full video is below.</description>

      <title>50W QRP Amplifier - Schematic, PCB Ver 1</title>

      <description>The 5W-to-50W QRP HF Amplifier project is rolling along nicely - I received the first PCB draft in the male this week and am 90% of the way through assembling it, with only heatsink-placement left to sort out.
I&#39;ve made a couple of additions to the schematic since the original layout, including a relay-activated indicator (R27 and its LED) and an RF-output sensing LED (from C14 to its associated LED to ground) along the the lines of VK3YE&#39;s recent project.</description>

      <description>This past weekend, I started on the process of laying out the 50W QRP Amplifier project as a PCB. Small PCBs can be remarkably inexpensive these days - $10-$15 for 5 pieces of say 4&#34;x4&#34;, shipped in 2-3 weeks. I&#39;m treating this amplifier project as a chance to experiment with different, similar FETs to learn about critical power MOSFET properties, and also as an opportunity to brush up my layout skills that I haven&#39;t used in awhile.</description>

      <title>50W QRP Amplifier - First Demonstration</title>

As I alluded to last week, I&#39;ve been working on a simple &#34;QRP Amplifier&#34; to kick my power up from 5W to something a little more punchy. Specifically, an amp I can still use when portable. There&#39;s something wonderful about achieving a contact with only 5W, but there&#39;s also the frustration of getting into the field and having band conditions just wreck your day.</description>

Following the Forth of July, I took a few days off of work to recuperate from a grueling work project that we pushed over the finish line on the third. And what better way to relax in the wake of a heatwave than getting out in the beautiful, low-70&#39;s weather and working on a new portable HF antenna.
